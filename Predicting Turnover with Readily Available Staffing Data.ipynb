    "# Predicting Turnover with Readily Available Staffing Data\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "Employee turnover is one of the most heavily measured and studied area in Human Resources.  Years ago, I attended a conference where a data scientist took a big data approach and developed an algorithm to predict how likely employees were to still be employed over a twelve month period.  He used objective factors that were readily available in most HR Systems across hundreds of companies and millions of data observations. I used his algorithm and replicated the findings at my company with similar results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, I wanted to go small scale. Are there any factors available in common Staffing and headcount reports that are good predictors of turnover.  I pulled two headcount reports:  One on the first day of the year and one on the last day of the year.  I merged the two datasets together to see who was still with the company at the end of the reporting period and who left sometime between the first and the last of the year.  This data is also commonly used to calculate Retention metrics (not to be confused with Turnover metrics, which are entirely different).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, I chose to run use Logistic regression given my outcome variable (Active or Termed at end of period) is binary.  My independent variable or factors are a mix of binary and continues variables.\n",

    "Although I'm not an expert at logistic regression (and Robert Kabacoff's book really helped me out), the Exponated Log(odds) make sense to me.  The best predictor in the equation is Manager Churn.  At first, I thought I coded this one incorrectly.  I would have thought that employees would be more likely to leave a company if they had a lot of different managers during the period.  However, that is not what is being measured here.  This factor is just that the employee ended the period with a different manager than they started with at the beginning of the period.  This factor could be a proxy for internal movement, promotion, transfer.  That is, people that are doing well are more likely to transfer and as a result, would be more likely to stay with the company.  Seniority turns out to be an important factor too.  The longer someone has been employed with the company, the more likely they will stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "FLSA status, or whether an employee is hourly or salary is also an important factor.  Hourly employees are more likely to leave during the period than salary employees.  Given salary jobs tend to pay more and have more responsibility, the direction of this factor makes sense.  Finally, Age does seem to contribute to the model, however in my opinion only slightly.  Older workers are less likely to still be with the company at the end of the period, but at 1.009, only slightly.  Maybe statistically significant, but probably not meaningful.  At least not for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there you have it.  You can gain some insight to who will still be employee twelve months from now just from some basic, everyday Staffing data."
