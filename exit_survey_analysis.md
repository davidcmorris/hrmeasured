# Exit Survey Analysis: Employee Voluntary Departure Comments

## Data Overview

This analysis covers **780 open-ended exit survey responses** from employees who voluntarily left Carrington Mortgage Services (CMS) / Carrington Real Estate Services (CRES). Employees were asked: *"Tell me why you left. Be as open and candid as possible."*

---

## Executive Summary: Top Findings for Senior Management

### The Single Biggest Finding

**Management quality is the #1 driver of voluntary turnover across nearly every job title.** The phrase "I didn't leave the company, I left management" appears in various forms dozens of times. Specific managers are named repeatedly across multiple independent responses, indicating systemic — not isolated — leadership failures.

### Five Critical Themes

| Theme | Prevalence | Risk Level |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Poor/abusive management & leadership | Very High (~50%+ of responses) | Critical |
| Compensation erosion (comp plan changes, no raises, no 401k match) | High (~30%) | High |
| Favoritism & nepotism in promotions and workload | High (~25%) | High |
| Hostile/toxic work environment | Moderate-High (~20%) | Critical (legal) |
| Lack of growth & advancement opportunities | Moderate (~15%) | Medium |

### Legal Exposure Flags

Multiple responses reference or threaten EEOC complaints, class action lawsuits, constructive discharge claims, HIPAA violations (manager disclosing medical information), racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation. These are not hypothetical — several respondents state they have contacted attorneys or filed complaints.

## Detailed Analysis by Job Title

---

### 1. Loan Officers (Retail, Branch, Centralized, Regional Sales Center, Outside, Portfolio)

**~170 responses** — the largest single job family.

**Key Themes:**

- **Compensation plan instability:** The most consistent complaint. Loan Officers report comp plans changing 2-4 times in a single year, always to their detriment. The shift from volume-based to unit-based tiers hurt top producers doing larger purchase loans. One LO summarized: "In 2 years I had 4 different compensation plans." Multiple LOs cite going from 95 bps down to 40 bps with no corresponding improvement in lead quality or support.

- **Lead quality and availability:** Loan Officers describe calling the same customers repeatedly (sometimes twice daily) via the Five9 dialer until customers are hostile. Portfolio leads are described as "septic" — overworked, burned out, and angry. No new portfolio purchases in 18+ months while adding 100 new LOs. Purchase leads had borrowers with 400-550 FICO scores and no down payment.

- **Operational bottlenecks:** Processing is consistently described as slow, understaffed, and adversarial. Loans routinely take 4+ months to close. Underwriters are described as over-conditioning files. Missing closing dates repeatedly damages LO relationships with realtors. Multiple LOs state they could not build a book of business because Carrington's reputation for slow closings preceded them.

- **Management quality:** Numerous specific managers are named as incompetent, demeaning, or absent. Producing managers are criticized for being too busy with their own loans to support their teams. Several responses describe managers without NMLS licenses, managers who yell on the floor, and managers who play favorites with leads and loan assignments.

- **No career path:** Multiple LOs were promised management roles that never materialized. One describes being groomed for a position, being a Circle of Excellence winner, having 10 years of experience — and watching someone less qualified get the role.

- **Work-life balance:** Expected to work nights and Saturdays. One branch mandated Saturday work if LOs didn't get three sales Mon-Thu. Emails from executives pushing numbers described as relentless and demoralizing.

**Representative quote:** *"The company is trying to squeeze too much from its people and it has caused, and will continue to cause, good employees to leave. The situation is made worse when employees do not respect their sales managers."*

---

### 2. RE Sales Agents (Real Estate Agents)

**~200 responses** — the second largest group.

**Key Themes:**

- **Broken promises on leads/REO listings:** The dominant complaint. Agents were recruited with promises of REO property assignments and lead generation that largely never materialized. Many completed extensive online training (40+ modules) only to receive zero or near-zero assignments. Several report that listings were funneled to a small group of favored agents or to the broker's family members.

- **Commission structure:** Agents describe the 70/30 or 80/20 split as excessive given the lack of support received. Additional transaction fees, "Players Club" deductions, sign fees, and other charges erode earnings. Multiple agents describe closing deals and netting under $500 after all fees. Several state they switched to 100% commission brokerages paying only a flat monthly fee.

- **Slow commission payments:** Agents report waiting 2-4 weeks after closing to receive commission checks. In an industry where cash flow matters, this is a dealbreaker.

- **Lack of broker support:** Many agents — especially new ones — describe receiving no mentorship, no returned phone calls, no guidance. Broker turnover is high; some agents report 3-4 different managing brokers in a short tenure. Several offices are described as inadequate (no phones, no color printer, outdated computers, poor parking, "like a morgue").

- **Training gaps:** New agents feel unsupported. Training is described as video-based and generic with no hands-on mentorship. Veteran agents say training was irrelevant to their experience level.

- **Boomtown platform issues:** Repeatedly cited as ineffective. Broken links, no local advertising (leads are California-centric), and zero conversions reported by multiple agents.

**Representative quote:** *"I spent $600 on signs, completed 40+ online classes, and then was told there would be no leads assigned to new agents for some time. EVERYTHING was a lie."*

### 3. Specialists (Customer Service, Bankruptcy, Loss Mitigation, Default MI Claims, Foreclosure, Special Servicing, and others)

**~130 responses** across multiple specialist sub-categories.

#### Customer Service Specialists

- **Scheduling:** The 11am-8pm shift is cited repeatedly as incompatible with family life, especially for single parents. Inflexible scheduling and a punitive attendance policy drive departures.
- **Management:** Several describe Customer Service management as dismissive, prone to favoritism, and "all about numbers, not the customers, not the employees."
- **Incentive plan problems:** The shift to a payments-based incentive plan is described as unfair — bilingual reps have a built-in advantage with guaranteed Spanish-language calls. Bonuses dropped from $700/month to $50/month for English-only reps.
- **No growth:** Attempts to transfer to other departments are frequently blocked. Internal freezes and manager refusals prevent movement.
- **QC as punitive tool:** Auto-fail QC policies remove entire bonuses for minor errors, described as "discouraging and a smack in the face."

#### Bankruptcy Specialists & Supervisors

This department emerges as a **particularly toxic environment** with the most concentrated and severe complaints.

- **VP Eric Harrison** is named by multiple independent respondents as creating a hostile, fear-based environment. Specific allegations include: leading by intimidation, threatening firings on the floor, hosting cookouts where only select employees are invited, telling an associate to "disengage" from a colleague, and telling unhappy employees to "seek employment elsewhere."
- **Favoritism in promotions:** Promotions described as based on friendship, not qualifications. Top performers denied advancement while less qualified friends of management are elevated.
- **Unethical practices:** One respondent describes being told not to note accounts during a remediation project "because seeing the note in multiple accounts would raise a flag to auditors."
- **No training materials:** Multiple respondents note there were no job aids, training manuals, or policies and procedures documents until employees created them — without credit.
- **Mandatory overtime** with no raises, no 401k, and no retirement savings is a common complaint.
- **Gender and nepotism concerns:** Department described as having "sexist" culture and "nepotism" built by management bringing in associates from prior companies.

**Representative quote:** *"I would have been happy to stay if there were different leaders in place. The problem starts with our VP... promotions aren't based on knowledge or qualifications; it's solely based on friendship. I really loved my job but I love my life more."*

#### Loss Mitigation / Special Servicing Specialists

- Management described as gossipy, unprofessional, and running "secret lists" of high-value accounts given to favored employees, creating massive bonus disparities ($3k-$8k/month for selected employees vs. minimal bonuses for others).
- Training described as "horrible."
- One veteran respondent alleges racial profiling (Hispanic employees allowed visible tattoos while the respondent was not; being written up for PTSD-related absences as a disabled veteran; managers speaking Spanish to exclude non-Spanish-speaking employees).

#### Default MI Claims Specialists

- "Micromanaged, no incentives, written up for using too much sick time."
- "Lack of strong leadership, a lot of favoritism, massive amounts of overtime with no yearly raises."
- Consistent theme: high workload, no growth, no retirement plan, poor management.

### 4. Loan Counselors (Servicing)

**~30 responses.**

- **Compensation stagnation:** Multiple respondents worked 2-3 years without a raise. New hires are brought in at $2-4/hour more than existing employees with more experience — described as "a complete slap in the face."
- **Management quality:** Supervisors described as "manipulative," showing "favoritism," and "threatening." One specific supervisor (Lorraine) is named by multiple respondents as hostile, going days without speaking, and telling employees to "stop being sensitive and be thankful you have a job."
- **Schedule volatility:** Frequent schedule changes with little notice. Saturday work added via email on New Year's Eve with no discussion.
- **Role misrepresentation:** Multiple respondents hired as "SPOC" (Single Point of Contact) reps only to find their roles changed to collections without consent. One writes: "If I wanted to be a collector, that's what I would have applied for."
- **Punitive attendance policy:** Traffic accidents, hurricanes, and medical emergencies all result in occurrence points with no flexibility.

**Representative quote:** *"I worked there for almost 3 years and received no raise. I never received any positive feedback. I had no opportunity to grow. If you gutted your management staff, supervisor and up, it would be a great place to work."*

---

### 5. Loan Processors (Retail, Branch, Centralized, Regional Sales Center)

**~30 responses.**

- **Abusive management:** Processors describe being yelled at, publicly humiliated, and told their numbers are inadequate. One response describes a manager (Jaleh Jenkins) openly calling processors "stupid" and "idiots" to other employees behind their backs, causing both processors in one office to resign despite lower pay at new jobs.
- **Unrealistic expectations:** Expected to process high volumes of complex manual underwrite files with insufficient support. Written up for low numbers caused by loan fallout — not processor error.
- **Comp plan cuts:** Processor compensation was reduced, and as volume declined, income became unsustainable.
- **No training:** "No training, bad technology" is a common refrain. Processors expected to learn on the fly with no job aids.
- **Work-life balance:** Expected to log in from home until all work is completed. Cell phones and laptops provided with the expectation of 24/7 availability. Vacation time is interrupted with calls and texts.

**Representative quote:** *"Management was absolutely terrible. The emails came in non-stop telling us how bad of a job we were doing. The stress level was out of this world to where I was starting to get sick."*

---

### 6. Account Executives (Wholesale)

**~15 responses.**

- **New management disruption:** Greg Austin's arrival is described by multiple AEs as destructive. He is accused of: reassigning territories without consultation, bringing in his own team, creating a hostile environment to force departures of existing employees, speaking poorly of departed employees, calling brokers to "fish" for negative information about former employees, and reducing commissions.
- **Operations failures:** Wholesale operations is universally described as a major weakness: no return calls/emails, lengthy turn times, loans never closing on time. Brokers become "one and done" — they send one loan and never return. AEs describe this as embarrassing and career-damaging.
- **Broker approval bottlenecks:** 1+ month wait times to get new brokers approved, with repeated documentation requests and poor communication.
- **Commission cuts:** Recent reductions are a recurring complaint.

**Representative quote:** *"Carrington is known in the industry as having terrible OPS — no return calls, very lengthy turn times and NEVER close a loan on time."*

---

### 7. Managers (Branch, Customer Service, Sales, Retail Lending)

**~25 responses.**

- **Pressure from above:** Managers describe being pressured to "drill and drive" employees in ways they find counterproductive. Expected to work 60+ hours/week with no work-life balance. Told "maybe I should just fire you" when raising concerns about support needs.
- **Lack of support and clear goals:** Goals described as shifting daily. "I have never been in a position where I did not know from day to day if my team's production was going to be acceptable."
- **Micromanagement from senior leadership:** RVPs going directly to branch staff, undermining the manager's authority and creating confusion.
- **Ethical concerns:** At least one manager explicitly left due to "willingness and encouragement of improper and unethical practices."
- **Promises not kept:** Multiple managers describe being hired with promises (territories, comp plans, resources) that were changed or revoked shortly after start.

**Representative quote:** *"You can't expect people to work for you and give 110% every day if you drive them to death and tell them they are just not good enough."*

---

### 8. Underwriters (Retail, Wholesale, Centralized)

**~15 responses.**

- **Unrealistic turn times:** Expected to underwrite complex manual/subprime files in 24-48 hours while carrying multiple new submissions, resubmissions, and QC reviews simultaneously. 12-hour days are routine.
- **Pressure over quality:** Production volume is prioritized over loan quality. One underwriter describes being "under constant pressure to approve loans that I never would have at other lenders" — raising ethical and compliance concerns.
- **Management incompetence:** Underwriting managers described as inexperienced, playing favorites, or being hostile. One UW reports a manager publicly disclosed their mental health hospitalization (potential HIPAA violation).
- **Health impacts:** Multiple underwriters describe developing health problems (high blood pressure, stress-related illness) directly attributed to the work environment.

**Representative quote:** *"I quit without any job lined up just to get my sanity back. Carrington is seriously borderline abusive — management pushes for productivity ONLY to reach THEIR bonus quota."*

### 9. Analysts (Loss, Foreclosure, Business, QC, etc.)

**~20 responses.**

- **No raises:** Company leadership's stated position of not offering cost-of-living raises because they are "not a socialist company" is cited.
- **Director behavior:** Directors described as taking credit for subordinates' ideas, being condescending, and lacking people skills.
- **Micromanagement:** "No talking to coworkers outside of breaks" — described as being treated like elementary school students.
- **Talent drain acknowledged:** "Talented people leave, so most left aren't management material, however they're promoted anyway."

---

### 10. Supervisors (Bankruptcy, Loan Counselor, Customer Service, Collections)

- **Hostile treatment:** One supervisor describes being called "Grandpa" and "old man" in meetings, with frequent questions about age (potential age discrimination).

---

### 12. Representatives (Customer Service, Customer Research — CMH/Westfield)

**~30 responses.**

- **Scheduling misrepresentation:** Part-time employees promised full-time hours, or full-time employees discovering the role was part-time after training.
- **Punitive culture:** Write-ups for having a phone visible, for attendance despite PTO availability, for questioning management.

- "Little to no training and organization."
- One paralegal returned from medical disability to find their position eliminated.

---

### 14. Other Roles (VPs, Directors, Developers, Accountants, Auditors, Funders, etc.)

- **VPs/Directors:** Even senior leaders cite lack of support from SVP and above, unreasonable expectations, and toxic leadership above them. One VP describes leaving a "sinking ship."
- **Developers/IT:** No 401k, no pay increases in 3+ years despite consistently "exceeds expectations" reviews. "Carrington does not care about its employees."
- **Accountants:** "Our department hadn't gotten raises in 5 years." Manager behavior described as unethical and hostile.
- **Auditors:** Undertrained, underpaid. One terminated for speaking up in a team meeting.

## Cross-Cutting Systemic Issues

### 1. No 401k Match
Referenced across virtually every job category as a reason for departure. Employees see this as the company being unwilling to invest in their future. Combined with stagnant wages, it creates a powerful push factor.

### 2. The "Carrington Culture" Problem
A distinct pattern emerges: employees who joined 2+ years ago describe an initially positive culture that deteriorated with senior leadership changes. The phrases "Carrington wasn't like this when I was hired" and "the culture changed when new management arrived" appear repeatedly.

### 3. HR Ineffectiveness
HR is described as unresponsive, ineffective, or complicit across dozens of responses. Complaints go uninvestigated. Employees who escalate concerns describe retaliation. Multiple respondents describe HR siding with management regardless of evidence. One employee describes HR laughing during terminations.

### 4. Named Individuals Appearing in Multiple Independent Responses
Several managers/leaders are named negatively by 3 or more independent respondents, suggesting these are verified patterns rather than individual grudges. These clusters of complaints around specific individuals represent the highest-ROI intervention points for reducing turnover.

### 5. Health Impact
A striking number of respondents describe developing anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, panic attacks, migraines, and other stress-related conditions directly attributed to their work environment. Several left without another job lined up specifically to protect their health.

## Strategic Recommendations for Senior Management

1. **Conduct management assessments** in departments with highest turnover (Bankruptcy, Loss Mitigation, Loan Servicing, Retail Sales Centers). The data points to specific individuals as root causes.

2. **Stabilize Loan Officer compensation plans.** Frequent, unfavorable changes are the #1 driver of LO attrition. Top producers leave first — and they take relationships and revenue with them.

3. **Implement a 401k match.** This is table stakes in the industry and is cited in every job category.

4. **Overhaul wholesale operations.** Turn times and service quality are destroying broker relationships and making it impossible for AEs to retain accounts.

5. **Invest in manager training.** Many managers were promoted for technical skills or relationships, not leadership ability. Basic management training on communication, feedback, and legal boundaries would mitigate both turnover and legal risk.

6. **Audit HR complaint processes.** The volume of employees who describe escalating to HR with no response, no follow-up, or retaliation afterward is a significant liability.

7. **Address RE Agent economics.** The fee structure and commission split are not competitive for self-sourced business. Agents generating their own deals leave for 100% commission brokerages because Carrington charges fees without providing commensurate value.

8. **Fix lead management.** Calling the same customers repeatedly via auto-dialer until they're hostile is counterproductive. Lead recycling and quality need attention.
