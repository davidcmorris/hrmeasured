Job Title,Tell Us Why You Left?
"Processor,LossMitIntk,II","For health and personal ressons, I no longer felt comfortable in my department. Most uncomfortable situation was the day I was publicly mocked for being in pain during pregnancy and compared to a ""complaining rape victim"". Once I get the clear to return to work, this is not an environment I'd feel comfortable returning to. "
"Manager,DefaultInvoice",Better work/life balance.  
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","Carrington, while the pay was excellent, the stability was horrible, I have never worked for a company that will tell you one thing then turn around the following month and say another. Not only that leadership there shouldn’t be people who judge others, and very bais; in the Two years I was there I heard nothing but negitative from ALL supervisors (except Crispen NyKa)and some employees. Which is not a good look for Carrington. Overall the management at Carrington are non- professional and need to be evaluated. This job was starting to play a role in my health which was the main reason had to make a decision to depart from Carrington. "
"Specialist,Bankruptcy,II","There were multiple factors that contributed to my deciding to leave Carrington however the main reasons were; Stressful work environment, lack of opportunity for growth and a lack of leadership from both upper and lower management.  /  / Stressful work environment-The work itself is not hard at all however during my time at Carrington (less than a year by about a week) I had become the Sr. Rep on the MFR team due to the high turnover rate. Although I was there for less than a year there was a backlog that had been around for about three years. Of course there was a push from both upper and lower management to work through the backlog however when the VP of Bankruptcy comes on the floor and says to the manager “if the can’t start producing then we need to start firing people.” it creates and unnecessary sense of panic amongst the employees. Granted I didn’t personally hear the VP say these words but I did receive confirmation from the Bk manager via text that those words were indeed said.  /  / Lack of opportunity for growth - I was at CMS for a little under a year however within my first month I knew I should have been hired as a Senior BK rep considering how much knowledge I had and how well I was able to work through the MFR process. i reached out to management MULTIPLE times inquiring about what needed to be done to move up but was given no direction and my requests were met with laughter however when I decided to slow my productivity down to ensure I wasn’t making any errors the idea was brought back up to me several times as a way to entice me into producing more but was never an opportunity for me.  /  / Lack of leadership - There were no valid avenues for communication with the BK manager if you weren’t producing the way they wanted you to. We would offer suggestions regarding high monthly expectation etc and be met with push back etc.  /  / All in all those three reasons were apart of my decision to leave CMS but the final nail in the coffin came when my then manager Karin Murphy decided that since I wouldn’t increase my production and risk making errors she would try to get me fired for attendance issues. A little background, Karin states on multiple occasions that as long as we were producing she wasn’t focused on attendance issues and as a result of my high productivity I’m assuming she over looked my coming into work late for my tenure with the company up until my last month that i. I went from zero disciplinary actions in a year to 3 within a month after bringing this up to hr one of the actions was reversed only to be reapplied within 1 business day. After informing the BK manager that I didn’t believe the course of action was fair or legal for that matter and would be seeking advice beyond CMS i was let go the same day I turned in my 2 weeks notice, of course I was paid through my end date. What’s puzzling is that my manager and I text one another frequently about work and non work related things and she mentioned my production needed improvement once or twice but never mentioned my attendance but that’s what she wanted to fire me for. Overall my experience at Carrington was subpar at best and I strongly believe that until there is a change in management in the BK Department there will continue to be a high turnover rate.  /  / I would also like to say that Mac Mitchell was by far the best part of the management team; he listened, followed up and acted when he saw fit. It’s unfortunate he became my supervisor so late in the process. I definitely believe there would have been a different outcome for me if I was on his team sooner."
"AE, Wholesale","Anything I say will sound like an excuse so in my opinion I am grateful Carrington gave me the opportunity worked for them.  I am better off for the experience.  Thank you, sincerely,  Robin"
"Spec,DefaultMIClaimsI","Rules were made up and leadership kept changing. My annual reviews were not taking place, there were meetings to discuss wage increases but when asked it was ignored. I’ve had 4 supervisors and 2 managers in a years time. The director Charles Trefry of the servicing department created a very hostile work environment. I was told many things about the attendance policy and those things were made up because I asked for such policy and management told me that they do not allow associates to see or have copies of the policy. How can you write someone up for a policy and not be able to show that person what you’re referring to? The turnover rate is ridiculous and it’s ridiculous all the way down to how many times my office seat has been moved during my time. HR is no help and doesn’t know what they are talking about or doing either. There are no tenured people within carrington. There is also no 401k match and carrington nickel and dimes you even for gift cards. Carrington is far from the general public that works there. Driving through cornfields daily shows that they want everything to be cheap."
"Supervisor,Bankruptcy","The VP of my department was challenging to work for. He seemed to lead by intimidation, demeaning people on the floor, and consistently threatening taking written or final action if errors were not alleviated. Understanding errors need to be addressed and resolved however there did not seem to be an allowance for human one-off errors. Comments were made on the floor by the VP about specific staff members who are lazy and do not pay attention to their work. It was a very negative environment where people were afraid to mess up. "
"Loan Officer, Retail Ctr","Because we moved to Colorado.  I actually did not want to quit the company however, there are no opportunities available with Carrington."
"Specialist,CS,Sr.","Lack of recognition and reward for good work, I.e. annual raises, promotions. Also, lack of transparency between departments and management. "
"Spec, Home, Vylla",I felt that my role was going to deliver best in class quality and service.  While in training my responsibilities changed to a yet-to-be-determined role.  I was told I would have options that were still in need of being defined.  The delivery of this change was less than quality.  It mocked those that may be impacted and it was short of quality management.  You cannot provide best in class quality and service while managed by less what we hope to project.
"Specialist,Cash Ops","No flexibility, no part-time or remote options available."
"Specialist,LossMitigation","I had already spoken to HR rep about I left, but if I must repeat my reason here goes. The supervisors had their favorites, and they had their clicks. I disputed a couple of things but it went to deaf hears. The supervisors are not well versed as far as coaching the employees, and sending out emails that should of been well thought out, instead of trying to be so ugly the supervisors didn't pay attention to the numbers on spread sheet to see why calls were missed. there is a number of things that weren't conducive for a new employee. The training program was horrible to say the least. / Best Regards, / "
RE Sales Agent,Carrington let all the part time agents go / 
"Specialist,BK,Sr.","I would have been happy to stay at Carrington if there were different leaders in place. I enjoyed working for the company and I really enjoyed the work that I was doing, which I was very good at doing. The problem with the bankruptcy department at Carrington starts with our VP. Eric Harrison is the most unfair leader that I've ever encountered in my 22 years of working. He produces a negative and hostile environment in the department which made it very hard for me to focus on the job that I was hired to do. Promotions aren't based on knowledge or qualifications; it's solely based on friendship and statuses. I was hired at Carrington on 11/30/2015. During my time there, I was never placed on any verbal or written disciplinary actions. I was also top performer in my department every month. When it was time for us to receive our annual review, I did not receive an increase. After speaking with my direct supervisor, I was advised that the review that was put in our system was not the review that he had written. I was given a does not meet in one of the areas stating that I failed on a loan.  I asked my management team to please provide me with the loan number that I failed on, but that loan number could not be provided. I was asked to assist with writing our policies and procedures. I did as I was asked but it also took away from me doing my main job which also took away from me getting my monthly bonus. In order for me to receive a bonus, I needed to close 70 loans. I closed 67 loans in the month of August and my supervisor submitted for me to receive a discretionary bonus since I was assisting with the policies and procedures along with other stuff. The request for me to receive a bonus was denied. The morale is low because the managers tear down the employees. Eric made an announcement during a floor huddle stating that if we weren’t happy, we should seek employment elsewhere. I’ve never been at a job that didn’t have a job aid or training manual.  I am the one that assisted in creating the one that we do have and I was never given credit for doing it. Our VP also has cookouts at his home where he only invites certain employees. I really never understood why Eric had an issue with me personally but I know I worked hard during my time at Carrington. I made mistakes but I’m only human. My error rate was very low. For my VP to tell another associate to disengage herself from me was the biggest kick ever. To this day, I’m not sure why this was said but I don’t think this is professional. Once Carrington places professional leaders in the company, I feel like the turnover rate will decrease. I really loved my job but I love my life more and the stress from management was not worth it. Thanks for the opportunity and I pray that things get better."
"AE, Whlsale, Inside","To discusss this matter, please reach me at 469-767-4241"
"Loan Officer, Retail II","Income dropped as outside variables changed. I want to be clear. That is the main reason. I had come to Carrington in hopes of growing with a company. When the opportunity came, I had applied for a management position that I was being groomed for by James Torrence to replace him as a sales manager. Rob Petruska hired someone less qualified in every category. Ultimately, I did not earn Rob’s trust so I’ll take full responsibility. That experience made me realize I had a very limited career path going forward with Carrington. After doing everything I could to earn a promotion (graduate Leadershift, Circle of Excellence, top 10 in production for the company, 10 years finance experience, 7 in management, BS in Business) and not getting it really made me rethink my future. I like Rob and have known him for 20 years. It’s his call who he hires and why. Rob hired me and I’m grateful. Ultimately, my income took a dip from 178K to tracking about 120K. That’s too much of a hit to stick with a company I can’t grow with. "
"Analyst, Loss","My current manager Patrick was awful. He did not interact with his employees, he would argue with his employees on the floor and call them piers for everyone to hear. There was NO good communication from upper management as well for me."
"Trainee, Loan Officer, I","I didn't leave. I had a family emergency I reported to my manager, then received a termination email for not being at work for 3 consecutive days."
"Specialist,PostClose,CTS","I loved working for Carrington Title Services, I had an amazing manager. I received a job offer and financially had to do what was best for my family. The offer came from a recommendation from a previous manager. "
"VP,RetailProcessing&Init","less travel, opportunity to advance my career, better home life balance "
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I",I feel departments do not communicate. There are unfair practices. For instance when traffic accidents occurrences are waived in collections  if there are numerous people coming in late while customer service is not. Lack of communication with Human Resources as well. Received an occurrence back in june for a traffic accident Human Resources was to investigate considering there was multiple people coming in late up from july up through oct I didn’t even get an email from Human Resources considering this issue. Some supervisors are poorly trained all have different answers to one question. Manager also seemed to have favoritism not to mention his superior have known each other prior.
"Manager,LoanProcess,Vylla",CMS willingness and encouragement of improper and unethical practices was not something I was willing to be apart of. 
"Funder, II",I was expected to go home and log in until everything assigned to me was completed.  I am my wifes full time care giver and I just cant go home and log in until everyone decided im done
"AVP,Broker of Record","The environment is toxic.  Communication from upper management didn't exist nor did they inquire/care about decisions that were made effecting my level and below.  The attitude was ""get on board or get out"" so I chose to get out after I couldn't take any more.  I didn't like the way they were treating me or my agents and I couldn't stand for it.  The morale is the lowest it had been in my 2 years with the company.  Everyone was afraid to lose their job and the company was losing money at a rapid rate without anyone in leadership having a clue on how to correct the situation.  I found an opportunity to jump off of  sinking ship and I took it.  "
"AVP,Rtl Branch ,Producing",Better opportunity for growing retail which has been part of my 25 year mortgage career.  I enjoyed working at CMS and the great employees it has. 
"Account Manager,Sr.","I left Carrington Mortgage Services due to the lack of work/life balance and management’s lack to understand that concept. Management lives and breathes work and as much as they might say they want you to have a life outside work they make it impossible with the work load and expectations of job duties. Management is not family orientated and is very closed minded when it comes to new ideas. On several occasions I suggested new ways to better customer service and also improve efficiencies. I was verbally reprimanded for suggesting these ideas being told it was not my concern or job. Lastly, the pay structure is unfair. You have account managers receiving $8k,$9k bonuses where you have others working just as hard or harder earning half that. This is due to unfairly distributing Account Executive accounts and amount of files. For instances an account manager with 90 refinances will close many more loans than an account manager with only a pipeline size of 40-50 purchases; however they account manager with the purchases will do much more work due to the purpose of the loan and will be compensated about half- which is not fair.

"Specialist,Special Servc.","No room for growth within, no 401K match, better benefits needed. "
RE Sales Agent,"I stepped away from real estate all together. I don’t have time for it right now, maybe in the future I will decide to come back"
"Specialist,CS,Sr.",I feel as though I had plateaued and it was my time to find a position that would appreciate my skillset and allow me to cut away from the proverbial customer service cords. 
"Loan Officer, Retail II",1. Lack of quality leads  / 2. Knowing other loan officers doing the same work were on much more lucrative comp plans. / 3. No sense of urgency on purchase loans. Missed 6 of the 8 closing dates I had this past summer.
"Loan Officer, Retail Ctr",The current business model to cold call all of Carrington’s current customer was a model I strongly disagree with. We attempted to call these customers  twice a day for 6-7 days in a row only frustrated customers to the point where they would advise they won’t do business with Carrington in the future.  This disconnect with the senior management was one of the many reason I left. 
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","I was told that I would get a raise for being transferred to back end and when asked when I was getting the raise I was told different reason and when I left they still didn’t give a reason as to why I haven’t received the raise as of now. Management was terrible and had their favorites, wasn’t treated fairly like other employees. Lorriane is the main reason I left, she was very unprofessional and said things that was hurtful. She used her authority as power over us she would go a whole day or 2 not speaking. One incident I email her a question and she told me personally that I need to stop being sensitive and be thankful I have a job. She always told us as a team that anything was to come back that she said she would deny it. I was on FMLA due to having major depression disorder and working under her wasn’t healthy for me and I was at the point where I didn’t feel the need to go to upper management cause I have before and no change. I am not the only one who feel this way about her!"
"Asset Manager,I","Even with perform reviews at 3.5 or higher we never get any higher salary rewards to keep up with the cost of livivng 3%, and the management team is not very open with production level employees. "
RE Sales Agent,Lack of leads and response time for broker questions.  Also many other agents departure.
"Paralegal, Litigation",Poor management. Not a team environment. Did not have clear job tasks. 
"Loan Officer, Retail II",It comes down to a shift in the business model.  As a loan officer i was not receiving enough inbound qualified leads to support the fundings I needed to support my family.  There were only 2 or 3 loan officers hitting the highest tiers in the entire company.  There are no more manual lists to call customers from like before the advent of 5/9 system.  5/9 was having me call the same customers everyday day after day and upsetting the customer. For the size of our portfolio i dont feel that Carrington marketed their customers properly to generate business. 
RE Sales Agent,"1. We were acquired by you from Real Estate Club, a 100% commission company / Conditions were changing first to 95% then to 90% and then you added a $395 fee with very little in added value to me as an agent / 2. I deal a lot with trusts which Carrington does not seem to understand well. Recently was asked that in every initial, every teustee must add: as trustee for the ‘seller trust’, eell somebproperties have 3 teustees, were do I put all tgat added verbage???? Made no sense / The trust says who is ( are the teustees) and can sign / 3. Unhappy with interaction with paperwork coordinator, I understand her pressure from corporate but we just were not communicating properly. I do not like constant conflict / 4. If I am not getting value from a company, conditions ate changing for the worst, company does not understand trusts and every paperwork is wrong, what reason I had to stay?"
"Spec,DefaultMIClaimsI","I've already explained to Iris that I truly disliked the work.  I understood that they were correct and still could find no logic.  Compounded by the fact that no cellphones are allowed, breaks and lunches are scheduled, even when no customer phone coverage is required.  It's a warehouse environment, and I never signed on for that.  It just wasn't a good fit for me."
"Loan Officer, Retail II","I was offered a position as an outside loan adviser with higher payout on self generated loans and much higher payout provided leads.  / I also left due to the structure of the process. The loan officer should be on the phone selling. there was not enough time to talk to as many people in a given day in order to reach max potential of sales. My new position wants me to focus on generating business, not doing loan officer assistant work, disclosure department work, and loan processor work. Although it is very important to submit a complete package up front, the task should be put in the hands of the team. More sales equals more profit.  / Lastly, although leads were provided, it was difficult to take 10 apps and deny 11. Not being able to submit a loan means there is no money to be paid. However, there was no time to do any self generated business which offered a higher payout. Not enough hours in the day to be successful."
"Asset Manager,I","Eric VanSingel is the WORST manager I have worked under in my professional career period over the last 13 years.  He is lazy (literally worked 4-5 hours per day) and unprofessional.  He has ZERO integrity, I have caught him in multiple lies.  He only gets away with this behavior because he is a white male in a ""white male dominated"" environment.  There is NO MINORITY who could have behaved in this way in kept his or her position.   There are absolutely no black leaders, mid to upper management at Carrington.  This company is not diverse and absolutely not headed in that direction.  I learned from experience when you speak about race or equal treatment/opportunity in the work place, you will be RETALIATED against. I watched Eric ONLY promote a woman (Patricia Gatewood) and create positions for her and blow her up to management because he was either having an inappropriate relationship with her or he liked her.  It was disgusting to see  the look in his eyes when he was around her and see how he could not contain himself in her presence.    They were either gone around the same times from their desks or coincidentally ""sick"" or on PTO the same days.   I understand this does not mean something was going on but previous and present employees made comments they felt the same way about the inappropriateness of their relationship but of course no one had the courage to speak up.  All the ""talks"" took place off and on the floor.  Everyone was afraid of being retaliated against (of course since everyone was either usually a minority in race or gender).   Eric is very ""crafty"" and manipulative in what he communicates to upper management.   He will reap all of those things back.  He will be the demise of his professional career one day.  "
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","I left mostly due to the direction the company is headed. I really did not like the fact that 50 employees were laid off in servicing when in the same week it was announced that 2 senior VP jobs were added. I also didn't like the change of the bonus structure in the loan servicing department. Above the director level in my department I didn't trust the most senior leadership roles. Plus the schedule was absolutely horrendous. My direct supervisor did an amazing job, crispin nkya is a true leader and an asset to the company. "

I had just relocated, and had no realtor connections. I was also told my goals were 1 credit pull per day, 4-6 loan submission per month. Seems like a very low conversion rate.  How do you motivate people? Carrot or the stick.  I just saw the stick. "

"Loan Officer, Retail","New SVP is not in alignment with the previous culture. New demands created anxiety and an uncomfortable feeling everyday.

A controlling environment is okay for the younger generation that need structure. I was a top producer and my previous leader allowed me to work my way as long as continued to produce and I did. Loved my time at Carrington prior to all the changes.  / I also was very unhappy when our compensation plan changed in June. 1st tier 20 bps for the amount of work on the loans.  /  / When I resigned 8.6 the SVP instructed that I leave the premises immediately as if i were a criminal without saying good bye to my co workers.

"Coord,DefaultInv,I",Valerie is an awful boss to work for. I M not sure how many pirple have to transfer out of her department or quit for someone to realize who and what the problem is. All she cares about is quantity over quality. She tells us to approve things that shouldn’t be approved. 
RE Sales Agent,I am dealing with breast cancer and only wanted a break until I get a bit better. / 
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I",Truly it was a good experience with CMS. This was more of a family reason and not so much a company issue. My one daughter would of had to wait another year and fall behind in the current curriculum she is on and didn't want this. As a less important were the subject of recent layoffs that would have been more of a minor concern but wouldn't have deterred me from staying on longer. 
"Specialist,Bankruptcy,II","The bankruptcy department is unfair and unethical. The same rules do not apply to everyone. And it says a lot when rules can't be given in writing. It was a major red flag when the remediation project was going on last year and we were told not to note accounts with what was done because seeing the note in multiple accounts would raise a flag to auditors. There was not a set remediation process. Carrington failed to follow the rules when a PCN wasn't filed. Carrington tries to get around that requirement by saying oh the debtor was delinquent or they still made the payment. I wonder if the CFPB, CH 13 bankruptcy trustees or the debtors attorney would agree. I doubt it, because I dealt with CMS attorneys that refused to file PCNs if the debtor wasn't credited for the unfiled PCNs. "
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","I wasn’t feeling comfortable under the new management that I was placed under, she made my work day very miserable and hostile. Carrington was a very nice place to work and I will honestly miss the place. I was really sad unfortunately but best wishes to the Carrington team!"
"Loan Officer, Retail Ctr","18 yrs origination experience. Have 6 yrs exp with servicing pool for refi's. Your servicing pool is Septic. This pool, while I was there was called day after day after day. Existing Customers wouldn't answer the phone. Many had call block or opt out for sales calls. Those that did answer mostly would curse the Carrington name. Upper mgmt wondered why there were so many payoffs from the pool that we never had a chance to talk to. That was the problem. Multiple people were calling sometimes twice a day every day. All the messages that I left for return calls...never had a return call. I requested to be removed from the phone dialer and develop a realtor referral of new purchase business. My manager didn't object. After my initial training and obtaining multiple state licensing I had been calling for refi's exactly 30 days when I knew this was not be profitable for me or Carrington. That is when I began to seek purchase business from realtors. I became clear that they wanted my time and energy to call the septic pool. I am and continue to be a salesperson. What is going on at Carrington is not sales. I preform my skills when put in front of unbiased consumers and Carrington failed at that and further did not allow me the opportunity to develop my own clientele."
"Analyst, Loss","Carrington does not to offer cost of living raises because they are ""not a socialist company"" as the president Ray so nicely put. The performance review system is so flawed that you can barely even get a raise even if you get high marks on your reviews. I moved laterally 3 times in my department and received recognition multiple times for consistently meeting my goals yet all I get is a trophy. The micromanaging and numbers driven departments are not pleasant atmospheres to want to be in. Also, whe. You have upper management that does not know how to properly talk to people is a big issue. Directors and higher need to also take management classes to better understand their employees. "

"Processor,Ops,I",I moved out of the area
"Supervisor,Bankruptcy",Leadership team does not lead properly. They are supposed to be leading by example with honor and pride.  
"Loan Officer, Retail Ctr",A couple reasons: one being the inability to close loans that were clear to close but somehow management specifically Aaron bordout did not  assist me or talk to the right people to get my loans closed in a timely fashion. Bordouts attitude and demeaner towards everyone on our team. He was too busy trying to figure out his job versus helping any of us. A co worker was fired because of a question Briscoe asked him. His response was so far from an answer it was disrespectful! Yelling obscene things to him. If Scott Sorenson was still my manager I would have stayed without a question. I respect John parsons as a manager and a person but think he made a bad decision hiring someone who did nothing but waste our time as lo’s. So th main reason I left Carrington and the same reason josh Bricker left the company and a couple soon to follow is AARON BORDOUT!
"Loan Officer, Retail","Training is only done so it covers some corporate criteria but it's not done to ensure that the LO receives proper sales trainig and support.

"Specialist,Property Pres",My old company offered me a position to come back. 
"Specialist,BK,Sr.",Upper management and favoritism and harrasment. That's the main reason and if you want to be sick you get written up. Bankruptcy department has allot of problems hopefully things get fixed or my or more people will be leaving.
"Specialist,Bankruptcy,II",New management brought in that was very disrespectful and condescending from day one. There were no advancement opportunities in the role I was given. I was relied on heavily to produce astronomical numbers which were never asked of anyone prior. Feedback from team members was never acted upon.
"Loan Officer,RetailOutsII",I honestly like the company and was truly happy with it. I left because I did not have the FMLA benefit yet and I had kidney stones and had to take some time off to get operated and when I called I let them know I was thinking of putting in my two weeks for personal reasons and was not asked why I was leaving but simply let go right on the spot. I was a bit shocked it all happened so fast but I took it as I must not have mattered much at the moment and did not go into details why I wanted to put in my two weeks. If asked I would have told them about my problem and would have been open about it but I was very quickly let go. I recommend the company as management themselves were great and extremely knowledgeable. I see tye company moving forward strong despite some employees leaving but I am not one of those that left for what happened on the team I was with I had just met my new upper management Leonard and was looking forward to taking over a position working out of a mutual friends brokers office. I do not blame anyone or anything for my departure just wish I would have had more of a talk from the person I spoke to that day. Usually HR was great which is why I went to them directly instead of my new manager. Jen in HR was very helpful in tge past and I was hoping she would have answered that day I would potentially still be with the company

"Loan Officer, Retail II",The overall treatment of employees is very unfavorable.  
"Specialist,LoanSet-Up,II","I never thought I would leave but after what happened in March with all the layoff's, my confidence in the Company was gone.   They let good people go but kept LO's that never produced one loan.    I felt that decision was was not well thought out.      I felt insecure about how long my job might last.          "
"Sup,LoanCounselor",The atmosphere was extremely stressful and unorganized.  There was some favoritism among staff which led to unfairness in the treatment of employees depending which team they were on.  Goals were way too easy which led to complacency and lack of effort - which also created an atmosphere of entitlement.  
"Specialist,CS,I","I left Carrington Mortgage because of my schedule. I am a single mother with a child and the 11am to 8pm or later depending on the call, then having to drive an hour to pick up my child from the babysitter at 9:20pm again depending on the last call, then still having to feed my child and get him ready for the next day would get him in the bed well after 10:30pm or 11:00pm and that is NOT ACCEPTABLE."
"Specialist,TitleCurtv,CTS","My boss and one of her longest employed there employees trashed talked everyone. The gossip was unbearable.

Several other title curative employees have expressed the same concerns and issues with me. They fear retaliation and keep their thoughts to themselves for the most part. "
"Loan Officer, Retail II","The reasons are many, but the short answer is I did not enjoy the job near enough to endure the daily grind from my SM.  The company is trying to squeeze too much from its people and it has caused, and will in my opinion, continue to cause, good employees to leave.  The situation is made worse when employees do not respect their sales manager(s).  Carrington has hired SMs who have never sold at CMS and do not have the training and/or skills set to perform the job with any real credibility.  Furthermore, I was told in Dec that I would be the next SM and would lead a new team.  Craig and I shook hands on it.  Then I heard nothing for a month and then two and so on.  After Craig left the company I learned there was a hiring freeze and I should've never been offered the position.  To make matters worse I held out hope that I would be replacing one of the current SMs because I offered experience and much needed positive leadership.  Yet, nothing happened other than the continual departure of good employees.  Granted, some that left needed to go or be let go.  But, there's no doubt in my mind (because I've been told by many) that the reason for the exodus was due to a lack of respect for management (preceeding Jimmy Torrence's arrival).  Everyone is simply baffled by CMS's apparent tone deaf approach to its SM situation in Scottsdale.  One SM in particular has a terrible record of attrition and despite Jimmy's best efforts (and previous VPs') continues to hound LOs with a daily grind of emails and long, drawn-out meetings with the same old, repetitive messaging and sales training.  While his intentions are good and his heart is huge, he often slides into familiar habits of that cause all, great frustration.  Let me be clear, again, there were some very negative folks that needed to go and they're gone.  The folks you have remaining are good, hard-working professionals who want to do well and be happy.  Unfortunately, they do not see this as a possibility in the current environment.  You will see more good people leave CMS in the coming months.  That's a terrible thing because I know I could've made a difference had I been given the opportunity to lead.  I brought credibility through job knowledge, experience, and a positive approach.  While I appreciated the compliments and support, the continued push from LOs for my promotion became frustrating, as well, as I knew it was not happening.  I am grateful for my time at CMS and those who had a positive impact on my career, including Jimmy Torrence.  Thanks for allowing me to offer my feedback.   "

"Analyst, Foreclosure, Sr.",The Leadership (Monica Hadley) is a manipulator and has weaponized her position. She only hires and promotes people who she can control.  She baits you into conversations and then uses what you say in confidence against you. Her goal is to tear down and not build up. She also talks about her personal life too much and says some very inappropriate comments about her sex life.  She is an EEOC violation waiting to happen 
"Asset Manager, Sr.","I look back on my employment at carrington and for the most part it was very pleasant.   If enjoyed working with my leaders.    I do feel that in January 2018 carrington violated  title VII civil rights act of 1964.   I was demoted without cause.  I had an amazing last quarter and an incredible 1st quarter of 2018.   I took on all challenges without complaints.   In 3/2018 i reported to a former peer that did not know the process,system and was working part time hours with a full time salary.  When I was a leader I often requested additional support but was often shot down due to P&L But my replacement received 4 new people and the CMS portfolio did not grow.     During the last 18 months my tenure my incentive was calculated unfairly.   My  peers did not have all the portfolio s calculated in there numbers.   For example:  when I had the USDA & STW port it was calculated in my numbers.  But as3/2018 those portfolios where not being caulated in my former peers. The demographics of my replacements  and my former peers receiving the repreive on the portfolios incentives is why I feel that I had civil rights violated.  I do not intend to take any legal action at this time.  I do hope with this information carrington does not continue this type of behavior.  In our current environment please take  this very seriously."
"Loan Officer,RetailOutsII","Fired way too many people which slows down processing and underwriting. Also decreased pay, didn’t improve on systems, products or pricing. It became an all around horrible place to work at. Very good when I got there, but did not adjust to the changing market well at all."
"Supervisor,MIClaims","1. My manager quit after I had been with the company just 3 months. My director was fired when I has been with the company for 4 months. And my supervisor peer quit when I had been with the company 5 months. That left only me and my director in the department. My training in the first few months was sub-par because my manager was disengaged and was on her way to resigning. Once these personnel moves occurred, my director was initially engaged in getting me up to speed. Because he is a director, he was pulled in many directions and our interactions became less and less frequent. Being in a supervisor role and not having the training and tools to support my team, the day-to-day functions became increasingly more difficult as more time passed. Also, I have been in management for some time now, and it has worn on me. I wasn't able to emotionally support my team because I personally was struggling to find the emotional strength in the workplace due to not having the job function skills I needed to lead successfully in my department. That made dealing with employee personal matters difficult, too. So I basically have grown tired of managing people. Lastly, I have not been the same person in the work place since my dad died three years ago. I always use the analogy of a human having 5 gears, like a machine. If I had 5 gears before my dad died, now I only have 4. I've tried the last 3 years to find it - I've forced myself to find it at times - and I just can't. I'm unable to put it into overdrive anymore, and a person should not be in leadership if they can't do that. These factors led me to my decision to resign my position at Carrington. "

"Analyst,DefaultClaimsQA,I",My husband took a job in another state forcing me to leave.
"Coord,DefaultInv,I",One reason for leaving was Management's dishonesty over pay. Annual reviews were delayed a year. Senior Management kept talking about how important the reviews are but delayed them at every turn. I also left because my department Director  told me directly that she would not promote anyone in her department. All supervisors would be brought in from outside. She said she did not believe anyone in an entry level position was worthy of moving up.
"Sup,DefaultInvMngt",I left Carrigron for multiple reason.  Mainly I did not feel I got the support from my director.  I did not receive support on situations with employees and instead upper management made decisions that negatively affected the department and the staff.   I felt disrespected and undermined on multiple occasions.  I felt I was not allowed to supervise my team properly.  Communication from upper management was nearly non existent.  
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","I worked there for almost 3 years and received no raise. I never received any positive feedback. I had no opportunity to grow. I was stifled when it came to giving new ideas. The schedule was unnecessary. The culture was far to micromanaged. The equipment was out of date. Changes were never made clear nor expectations. My last supervisor was manipulative and showed favoritism every chance she got. Management never backed up reps only supervisors. Management spoke to us without respect often. Many idle threats were given by supervisors and managers. Any concern brought up was never resolved nor did we receive any feedback. No clear protocol on how to coach and give corrective actions. All and all if you all gutted your management staff supervisor and up, it would be a great place to work. "

"AE, Wholesale","Greg Austin and his new management team are untrustworthy.  He was going to change my operations center from Anaheim to Windsor without even consulting me and regardless of the fact I had built relationships over the previous 3 years with Mike Suchy and his team.  The new management team really have no idea how FHA, VA, and USDA loans work or wholesale in general for QM/ATR loans.  Greg made sure to alienate the current employee base so he could bring in his own people.  Rick Harway was a COE winner and did $353 million in 2017 along with having 3 employees in the Top 10 for 2017, including me.  Greg hired 2 people to take over for him.  So, when Rick did not take another position, Greg made certain to create a difficult working environment to facilitate Rick's departure. Greg also spoke poorly of Rick and others to employees at Carrington along with telling an AE she was viewed as worthless.  Greg has since called my former CMS approved broker base and as they have told me "" was fishing"" for negative information about my work ethic, knowledge, and service.  This could be considered a Title VII violation if he is telling anyone outside CMS or in other CMS departments (e.g. Operations) anything which would reflect poorly on my employment with Carrington.  / I hope things get better fast as I do not want the people whom I care about in Operations and other departments to lose their jobs due to lack of volume.

Every week, we were told we are going to lose our jobs since we couldn’t hit their number... well we didn’t get 80 loans to push?!? So I don't understand how that was our faults? The communication at Carrington was terrible. Nobody wanted to help each other out. It was every man for themselves which was very hostile. I was not able to handle all of the pressure management was dishing out. The stress level was out of this world to where I was starting to get sick because of all the stress and anxiety of not pleasing my manager. So I decided to leave.  / As a company, it is very unorganized and they seem to not care about the people working for them. They are all about money and that’s not the way to treat people.

"Specialist,Document,TL","I went out on short term disability due to severe major depression and chronic migraines.  While on leave my AVP Patrick Hagar told people I admitted myself into a ""Nut House"" and didn't know when I would return. Once I returned to work on 4/16 I felt very uncomfortable and felt the environment being hostile. I put my 2 week notice in but didn't return. On the next day 4/17 I received a voicemail from my AVP Patrick Hagar that said I left without saying goodbye and for me to ""Show some class"". This has affected me medically, mentally and emotionally!!!! I have always been a great employee but I didn't deserve the embarrassment, humiliation or harrassment call! There is more to this story but this is just a little insight.  The Management there always go around spreading people personal business to other employees and I'm a witness on that note. I guess Jerry Kitchen told Patrick that I was in the hospital/facility but I never gave him or any HR personnel authority to spread my medical situation to anyone.  I was told by HR and trusted this info would be confidential and it's also against HIPAA  laws. This kind of information should be protected. I also have the names of the employees he told this information to and it was spread to the whole floor! So you could imagine how I felt when I returned back to work. People were treating me differently and telling me what was said to them while I was out of the office. I feel discrimination due to my mental state and harrassed! Maybe you can give Management more training! Please note this is just ""a little"" insight"

Department internal conflicts ultimately caused my departure. "
"Loan Officer, Retail II",The Loan Officer comp plan was reduced several times over my time there.  The inbound calls were at a low point.  Solely making outbound calls put me as a telemarketer and I did not have a positive outlook for that type of sales.  An outside sales position was presented to me and I feel I would prosper at that job description.
"AE, Wholesale","Commissions decreased 2 months ago; new management brought in that has a management style that isn't conducive in a sales environment.  Greg put the responsibility on the AE to get more business within 30 days 'or else' (meaning we would be fired) when the training and change is desperately need in OPS- massive improvement is long overdue.  Carrington is known in the industry as having terrible OPS (no return calls/emails), very lengthy turn times and NEVER CLOSE A LOAN ON TIME. Brokers would only send me loans no one else could do or they were 'one and done' because we couldn't close the loan on time and since Carrington doesn't value the broker relationship we were told just to go out there and get more brokers.  That's insane.  OPS is what needs to be fixed-not put pressure on AEs to get more business as a first line of attack-that comes in due time once the infrastructure is fixed.  Our govt pricing was the best until last November then subs slowed down because of it.  My regional mgr was demoted to an AE (you've got to be kidding me) so Greg could bring in his own team.  That is a terrible thing to do unless his intent was for most of us to leave which is what ended up happening.  Comergence is a frustrating process for most brokers-too many docs up front and Comergence had terrible customer service-this should be streamlined and just use Docusign or email.  Conditional approvals are terribly long.  It's normal to have 20-30 conditions on any non-streamline loan.  That's outrageous!  Carrington claims to have no overlays but by looking at the conditions you would never know that.  Carrington makes it difficult to close a loan and that's where the focus needs to be along with valuing the broker relationship.  Carrington mgmt has no idea how difficult it is to 'just get new brokers'.  It's a process that in the majority takes months. Plus, Broker Approval had terrible response time.  I had 4 brokers earlier this year that took ONE MONTH to get approval.  I didn't get a response for a week or even two at a time and there were multiple requests for documentation from the broker.  It was a ridiculous process and was embarrassing when my broker would complain and say the same. In my opinion Carrington has a lot to improve upon and the recent changes just lost a lot of talented people."

"Specialist,Special Servc.","There are multiple reasons why I decided to end my career with Carrington Mortgage Services. One of the main reasons was due to a lack of transparency with management. Management would hold some associates accountable for their actions but not all. You had associates that were being written up for reasons that we're never clearly outlined nor were they in the policies and procedures and then you had other associates that committed the same offenses on numerous occasions and were never addressed which created a sense of favoritism throughout the department of Loss mitigation. Management also dictated which associates were privileged enough to receive higher monthly bonuses. There have been plenty of instances where associates addressed management about secret lists that were sent out to ""select"" associates giving them an unfair edge in the monthly incentive. Management stated the rumors were false even after associates that received the lists from the Anaheim location and forwarded them to the Plano location to review. This instance had the ""selected"" associates bonusing between 3-8 thousand dollars a month on incentives while the other associates were left working hard on unworkable accounts thus impacting performance. There was an issue that came about during my time away from Carrington to where I reached out to my managers for clarity and to handle said situation before my return and management did not respond to my calls, emails, or texts messages. All in all Carrington mortgage has been by far the worst place that I have ever worked for especially considering the fact that the management staff orchestrated a well thought out plot to write me up and put me on a performance plan that would've impacted my biggest bonus I ever received while at the company which was around Christmas time. Management showed no compassion considering the fact that they were trying to take my bonus even after the fact that they delivered the write up while I was out of the office while addressing my disagreements with the write up I was advised by management ""it is what it is"" and to ""do what's best for me and my family."" HR sided with me after heated back and forth dialogue which ultimately resulted in HR overturning my initial write up and providing me with my Christmas incentive. While out on leave dealing with a variety of ailments I decided that Carrington is not a great place to work. The management doesn't care about its associates the later part of my time with the company was filled with stress and confusion. Gossip amongst the team and with management was the final straw for me to hear gossip all day long even while I was out on leave was concerning and the fact that managemt was also involved in said gossip was enough for me to make the decision to take my talents elsewhere to a company that truly appreciates me and what I have to offer. I hope Carrington hires new people to run its operations because as constructed right now it's not being led by ideal management and the sad thing is it's plenty of other associates that feel the same way as I do and if Loss mit isn't careful there is a strong possibility that a lot more of their associates will be leaving the company also. / "
"Mngr,Payroll",Medical reasons.
"Mngr,Area Sales, Whls",I was a Circle of Excellence producer and a top performer manager. The company “eliminated “ my Area Sales Manager position as part of a reorganization. Then two weeks later Greg Austin hires in his own Region Manager in my area?  Makes no sense at all. Not to mention that he never once spoke to me or even sent an email. Totally unprofessional in my opinion. I left because the senior leadership team is has lost touch with heart of the organization.

"Loan Officer, Retail II","I emailed my resignation letter to Sr HR Jerry Kitchens (please read it)  / New manager (A. M) treated me unfairly (other los witnessed this and told me to notify HR, they were fed up with his behavior and demeanor towards me since he did it publicly and humiliated me)  and all he tried doing was getting me written up instead of doing his job of managing and training. He also gave best leads including online leads to only 3 of his favorite los. I know this because I sat next to one and always heard “thank you for calling Carrington...or “I’m calling you in regards to your online inquiry...” we never got those leads so of course those few los had better numbers.  / Then New VP (Jimmy) came a month ago, which we were all so excited for since we thought he would protect us, bring  equality, and make us ALL more successful but instead, all he implemented was more write-ups and made it clear that he will get of us all out since we lacked production) I tried to talk to him but he wouldn’t listen. He had a final warning for me which I didn’t sign since my first write up was only 6 days prior. That’s when I contacted Jerry kitchens. Many good Loshave left and continue to  leave (we all communicate). Many lo’s have left for same reason. They n jimmy talks negatively about us all who have left saying that we had very poor numbers, etc (they have meetings like this) All management has been doing for several months is writing everyone up (I was first to be written up, then one by one all the others, except 4). Now there are 13 Los remaining and more will be leaving. What’s very sad is all we wanted was to become more successful with proper training and better technology and what we got was written up and threatened that if numbers don’t go up we will all be let go of. That is why we all left (we are all friends). We went to work in fear everyday, fear of no loans or fear of getting written up or terminated. So we took it upon ourselves and resigned once we had a new career. Word has spread all over linked in and local mortgage companies. I hear “what are they doing over there at Carrington that so many los have left in such a short time?” There needs to be an HR person stationed permanently at the Scottsdale branch. I used to love  working at cms but now I’m so happy to be out of there and I’m doing really well at my new company. I’m myself again having great conversations with homeowners and making their lives better which I why I became a loan officer (I used to be a teacher). The sad part is, I left behind a few good los but they are also looking for better jobs. We talk daily and they say that it’s awful there and they can’t wait to get out but what’s keeping them there is fear of getting the bill for their licensing (which some have gotten) I was fortunate since I had my year in dec. Please investigate into this since these are people’s lives that jimmy and Andy are messing with. It’s not a joke and EEOC might want to hear about this. "

I made every effort to contact my manager, Andy, via text and then email once I was finally able to use a computer .  As of today , I haven't heard from Andy or the Scottsdale manager James Terrense .  The only reason that I know his name  is because other associates told me.  Personally and professional, I believe that this is unacceptable for any company.  "
"Specialist,CS,I",The work environment was overwhelming for me. The office was too big. There were too many people talking at the same time. Managers talking and laughing loudly. It was very difficult for me to focus and concentrate. 
RE Sales Agent,There was no Synergy with in the office.   Many of the programs that were suppose to be implemented never followed through through completion.   Reduced amount of REO inventory and fewer assignments.
"Specialist,CS,I","I left with regret since I just recently gave birth to my child in February and even though the company provides you with six weeks of paid leave, I was going to manage returning if I found childcare that I was satisfied with and that put me stressed. It had nothing to do with the company it was amazing working with amazing people I look forward to reapplying again in the future when my son is a little older."
RE Sales Agent,"100% commission with less than $2,000 cap a year with no other fees.  Quick payment the next day after closing. Not really interested in doing REO properties. "
"Specialist,Bankruptcy,II","The culture in the Bankruptcy department is sexist and upper Managament built a culture of nepotism. The Human Resource agent in Plano is unqualified and she has been seen laughing at employees as they are being terminated. Also, these is no such thing as Mandatory Over time, you can't hold your employees hostage. Eric Harrison and Brian McGarry are the 90% cause of your high turnover rates in Bankruptcy. How many more employee complaints will it take until a course of action is taken?  My high work ethic and zero attendance issues kept me out of their office, thankfully. However, they always found a way to belittle all those around me. Managers quitting, walk outs, managers demoting themselves...Brian and Eric are the common cause in all these actions."
RE Sales Agent,Territory manager Freddy Rodriguez was great with me at all time and I learned a lot from him. Main reason was the comission split that did not worked out for me. 
"Analyst,Treasry,Faclty,Sr",Long daily commute from Corona to Aliso Viejo.
"Specialist,BK,Sr.",Management treated employees as though everyone was replaceable.  Those exact words were told to me.  Cms does not appreciate their employeess.  We were talked to very inappropriately and promises never kept.
"Loan Officer, Retail II","I reason I left was the I was forced to change comp plans when I didn't want too. The plan cut my pay in half, I was told upper management suggested that I move to the new comp plan because of my monthly avg. of 4 which was the floor minim to stay on the old comp plan. I feel like I was forced to change and with the rates moving up it made it alot harder to make the money I was making to survive there. I was sad to leave but the pressure was way too much. Very micro manage at Carrington."
"Loan Officer, Retail",I was not in a position to succeed with the new sales quotas given the current rates rising 
"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside",I am new in the purchase side of the business and needed more assistance and guidance in getting going with ramp up my business. 
"Specialist,Default Vendor","Low compensation, weak management. Carrington does not value its employees "
"Rep,CustomerResearch,CMS","My boss Jennifer fox is best friends with aileen’s Wife.  Aileen works in research department and so did I.  I went a couple of times with a small group in our department and Jenn, Laurel Gilbert, Aileen and her wife were all there.  I decided to not to go anymore.  After that Aileen started to harass me at work.  Came into my work area and told me fuck your, stood at her desk and told me what the fuck you looking at. I went to my boss Jenn she told me go seat down and wouldn’y Let me really tell her what happened because she said she heard it.  Later in a meeting when I brought it up how I was scared Aileen was going to do something, and repeated everything, she told me she didn’t realize she came into my work area and said it too.  When I went into my vapor Dalia’s office she told me I was a gossiper and when I said me because I was shocked.  I barely talked to her.  She said if it wasn’t me It was with who I association with.  I told her I was scared Dalia told me if she does anything she will be fired. So she was willing to put my life at risk and wait for her to do something.  She told me I was nothing to Carrington and that they would fire me in a heart beat. I then went to hr. She told me She would look into it. When I asked for an update and to try to have a meeting she would never get back to me. I literally had a call from my work phone like I was calling from outside the office and she finally answered. All the data and l she would look into. When I asked for an update on the try to have a meeting she would never get back to me. I literally had a call from my work phone like I was calling from outside the office and she finally answered. When I finally got a meeting with her she told me Aileen was not  supposed to walk by my desk. Which she did all the time .  When we move downstairs they put her in the next cube right next to me. I felt very threatened and I felt like Carrington didn’t care. My boss  is best friends with her wife.  So she didn’t really care.  Before joining the research department I had no issues and worked hard. The was stressing me out and I couldn’t sleep.  My life and  well being is not worth dealing with this.  I really like Carrington but the management is awful.  After I went to HR my VP and  boss were trying to get me fired and wrote me up.  I have witnesses to all of this. I recorded my meetings as well because how bad I was being treated.  I have contacted the EEOC and will be contacting a lawyer.  This is awful and Aileen should have been fired.  I am not the only person she has tageted and been mean too.  She makes fun of people all the time their.  To sum it up she is a bully and gets away with it because who she is friends with.  So I had to find another job, I have a family to support."
"AVP,Broker/Manager",Work/Life balance opportunity
"Loan Officer, Retail II","Reason #1 - Compensation plan - you cannot have a units based comp plan when the average units are less than 3-5 per LO per month. To recruit “good” LO’s you have to have a volume based comp plan from loan #1.  /  / Reason #2 - Management & Leadership - in this site you have managers that are not experienced enough to run/help/guide a sales team or help improve their production. Just telling people to make more dials, and get more app’s, and have more submissions does NOT a good manager make. "
"Coord,DefaultInv,I","Director knows a lot about the industry, but her leadership skills are severely lacking. My first team meeting was employees argument about how pay and other perks weren’t fair, mgt should get to leave when they want and the director saying we’ll i have earned where I am at and that includes perks. She completely lost controls of the meeting. No supervisor or director ever set expectations before the meeting or what would be discussed. I would say their ability to conduct a meeting is subpar. Director sent emails that their would be “serious” discussions if folks didn’t do their invoicing in the order she said. The idea of the email was fine. But is was condescending, included grammatical errors and in the end was just a rant. I can’t even list all the areas of leadership this team is lacking. If there is no leadership, the futures of the employees will inevitably suffer."
"Loan Officer, Retail, Sr","I left simply because of pay and processing.  I had been at Carrington for 2 years.  I loved it there and did not want to leave.  I was almost 100% self sourced and 99% purchase business. when the compensation changed to where units kicked you into the next tier and volume didn't, I had to make the hard decision to leave.  Since I was doing no refinances and all purchase business, it didn't make sense to have to close 9 loans to hit a top tier of 1.5 bps when I couldn't control the timing of the contracts coming in.  In addition, the Processing Department was thin.  We had let go of a number of processors and had one true fully functional processor for purchases.  In order to get 9 or more units each month, I'd have to obtain additional real estate agent partners and I didn't have the confidence that the processing department would be able to handle the volume of everyone and allow me that opportunity.  I had to truly make a heart wrenching decision to leave after making it to COE 2 years in a row.  Had the pay stayed where volume would drive you over to the next tier, I would still be sitting there at Carrington where I had intended my future to be for some time.  I had hoped to work on transitioning to Management and growing my career with Carrington but in order to continue to provide the same level of comfort for my family and be able to keep the income consistent in order to purchase a new home for my family, I had to make the decision I felt was best for us at that time.  If you have any questions, you are welcome to call me at 904-716-2540.  I loved Carrington and would still recommend Carrington to others. "
"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside","The company itself has great products and a great platform. I left Carrington Mortgage due management being inefficient and not providing adequate support, along with the difficulty in speaking with my direct manager. There was little to no support when it comes to pushing loans through the process as well as not being a liaison with other departments. This in essence makes it very difficult to get loans approved, and even more difficult to get loans funded, which means no one makes money. "
"Specialist,Foreclosure,II",To be closer to my family.
"Analyst, Loss","I shared my very candid reasons with both my supervisor and my manager, as well as HR. Director of the dept was a horrible leader, condescending, brash, abrupt, 0 people skills. No 401k match when we're told how well the company was doing and how it was all because of us (workers). Selfish and unappreciatuve. Talented people leave, so most left aren't mgmt material, however they're promoted anyway. Stress and pressure to produce with no emphasis on quality, rather quantity, leaves a chaotic mess up the chain. No raises... Merit or cost of living, despite effort, leaves one with no motivation to continue to give above minimum. No talking to coworkers outside of breaks was allowed, leaving a feeling of being treated like elementary school kids. I could go on, but I know upper mgmt won't do anything to change the culture. Most of my coworkers feel trapped and lack the support or confidence to leave. Just a very smothering place to spend 8-10 hours a day.  "
"Loan Officer, Retail II","Direct Management. Please realize that so many people have left not the company but the Manager. No follow up, no accountability, no leadership. I loved Carrington as a company but unfortunately my direct Supervisor Frank Caruso ruined the experience. I have never been so frustrated working for someone. Great person individually but has no idea how to lead people everyone was frustrated. Had to learn to work around him because he hid behind blanket emails all day, didn't have any knowledge of products, systems or people. We were told we had to switch to blended compensation plan, then they cut the comp plan to making 20 bps. no chance to make any money and to have a manager yell at you to get setups, processing not moving files and to not make any money, no choice but to leave. Manager lost 10 people in my short 6 months there all out of frustraton"
"Analyst, Collateral",New opportunity at another company.
"Funder,Sr.",The management is very poor! No training or patience. I felt very singled out was very stressful because I wasn’t able to effectively do my duties and roll because of poor management. Team lead very disrespectful and rude which cause me to become stressed on a daily basis. 
"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside","I was approached with a better opportunity ,leads,and a better bps on self gen deals."
"Loan Officer, Retail II","The processing in Scottsdale was unacceptable, we were asked for a deal a day and there were no demands on the processing and underwriters, As a loan officer based on Carrington pay structure we were only paid on fundings, it was not unusual for a deal to take 4+ months"
RE Sales Agent,I left the Boca office for several reasons.  Firstly most of the agents in the office are newly licensed and inexperienced I need to surround myself with seasoned professional agents.  Secondly the manager was assigning the REO listings to his wife which I felt was a conflict of interest.  Lastly most of the transactions I close are in Broward County the Boca office was no longer convenient for me.  
"LoanOfficerAsst,Branch,I",Horrible experience . It was a nightmare working for Eileen Collins. Had to get human Resources involved and was treated like an enemy. 
"Loan Officer, Retail II","In 2 years with the company, I had 4 different compensation plans. Despite the positive spin by management, these changes were not in my favor. The last one is the one that prompted me to leave because they took away the ability “tier up” based on loan volume. To reach the same tier equivalent with what was formerly $1,000,000, one must now close 9 units. This would result in a significant pay decrease. Management wants us to operate like a high volume call center (such as Quicken or loanDepot), but the company is too inefficient to offer LOs the opportunity for success in such a model. Chad Ruggles is the worst senior manager I have ever had the misfortune of being around. He simply does not care about employees at all. I personally saw an email that was only sent to sales managers, in which he stated that the success of the individuals on the team isn’t what was important, but only the sales manager’s personal success. Morale among employees is terrible. LOs work under a tremendous amount of pressure to perform at a high level or face the threat of losing your job. It’s a level of pressure that negatively affects personal life and, quite frankly, just isn’t worth it. The constant expectation shoved down your throat of doing more while at the same time being paid less to do it. In addition, the retail centers have become nothing but in-house refi shops (the loans that pay the least on the pay plan). There is zero emphasis on (or time allotted for) generating outside business, which is what actually pays decent amounts. The company doesn’t share best practices internally. Instead of just demanding more out of LOs, why can’t sales management show exactly how another loan officer in a different retail center is able to submit 20-30 loans in a single month? I can tell you processes in the Nashville center are not such that any loan officer could submit 20 loans in one month. "

"Loan Officer, Retail II","Carrington was good to me.  My boss, David Andrus was very good to me.  I loved my team.  I just came from a background in sales where I worked outside the office and had interaction with people face to face.  I was not designed to work daily in a call center.  I decided to leave the industry and start my own business outside the industry."
"Loan Officer, Retail Ctr","Direct management  was Frank Caruso and was the most underknowledged manager I have ever seen. He assumed no responsibility for files sent to processing,  training of new Lo's, or onboarding because he simply did not know the answers. Files hardly closed in the office as no one knew how to process a file. The office VP was non existent on the floor. I have 13 years experience as an LO and Carrington lost 2 other experienced Lo's  with me because of these issues ."
"Specialist,BK,Sr.","The department was very disorganized, low pay, too stressful, too much work, people around me constantly complaining about going to another company, no management and unprofessional. I was assigned 236 loans on my first day without any training on systems, policies, procedures or any real direction. "

RE Sales Agent,"My objective joining Carrington was to establish a Solar + Real Estate Alliance. I primarily work in the Solar Sales Industry but am also a licensed realtor since 2006. I cannot commit to selling real estate full-time. I was working with Jerry on program to educate Carrington Realtors. After Jerry left there was no longer that platform. Because Carrington is a large corporate system it would make implementing my plan more difficult to gain approval. Additionally, since I live in Murrieta, the Rancho Cucamonga office is further away that I want to go for meetings, that I don't have time for right now anyway."
RE Sales Agent,"Hi, so sorry I am late on this.   /  / Carrington Real Estate is an excellent company and my only problem was that it is residential and I am totally commercial,  I mistakenly thought it would have more of a commercial slant.

"Loan Officer, Retail II",I wanted to become an underwriter and my branch manager for jax sales 1 said that i wouldn't be able to go to underwriting that i would have to become a submission processor first then a processor then to underwriting after a couple pf years. I truly loved the company bur did not want to do sales any longer and a anothrr company offered me an underwriter iv position so i took advantage of the opportunity that I have been waiting for.   My sales  manager was aware that I wanted to become an underwriter when I started my employment with Carrington And I feel as though nothing was done to put me in the position I was looking for and develop my career.  I was also told by the branch manager that I would be unable to return to Carrington if I ever wanted to do so and I felt that was very unprofessional because  It's not like I left the company to go work for another mortgage company as a loan officer.I did not leave Carrington to go to another sales position I left Carrington  to go to an underwriting position which I wanted to do for several years  And to say that I can never work for Carrington again isn't fair because I didn't leave to go to sales somewhere else and then want to come back.  I left so that I could do a position and develop my career like I've been wanting to do for a long time and like my direct sales  manager knew this from even prior to me starting at carrington.   I knew my cells manager at a previous company we had worked for and she called me last year to try to recruit me but at the time I was working everbank as a loan officer and told her I wanted to become an underwriter and i was going to stick it out with everbank. When I left ever bank I applied to Carrington for a sales position and did not even go through that sales manager who tried to recruit me  which I had known for years from working with at a previous company anf i still got the position  And then when I did get placed on her team she was aware of my career goals.  Due to the fact that the branch manager told me I was not eligible for re hire if I left I am going to answer I am unlikely to return to Carrington because per that branch manager I'm not allowed to do so if I ever wanted to which I am not very happy about because i really liked Carrington and enjoyed working there as well as the company as a whole and my coworkers.
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","I did not leave, I take it that I was terminated. I was to report back to work on January 25, 2018, but it turned out that at that time, I was back in the hospital again for some surgery. I would still like to return to work and provide documentation for my absent. Believe there was some missed communication, contacted Shannon, but there was no return call from her, about my absent, but it was after I was released from the hospital."
"Specialist,Escrow Analys","I'm not the type of person to blame others for my problems, but I honestly left the company because I felt that I was being unfairly targeted by members of management within the department. I was being treated unfairly up to the day I turned in my resignation letter, where I had warmly expressed my pleasure with working with the company, only to be told that I'm to be paid out and can't work my last week despite wanting to do so, because of ""everything that has happened in the past."" /  / I have followed the company policy, raised issue with it when something did not make sense, and from that point forward I was nitpicked and at one point directly told that they changed the policy because of me.  /  / I enjoyed working with Carrington in the call center. The environment was much different, people were much more enthusiastic, and I felt like I had room to grow. I was resisted at every point during my time in escrow, whether it be when asking for more responsibilities or feedback and going months without either, or the judgemental comments leadership would make when something wasn't understood, or offering improvements only to have it interpreted as making management seem incompetent and unable to handle it themselves. My enthusiasm for the job quickly went out the window. The gossiping, nepotism, passive aggressive attitudes, rude sideways comments, all from members of management, all the way up to the vice president of the escrow department, made me lack any sense of confidence in the leadership, and I felt that my job was at risk. I felt unwelcomed and uncomfortable at work. I felt unable to complain to anyone for fear of retaliation. Every time I've complained to HR it's been with a different person, so I don't even have anyone I can follow up with.  I explored all options before leaving the company, however I felt that I was no longer valued.  /  / I would also like to take issue with the fact that I was written up 4 times in 3 weeks after requesting to transfer from the department to another area. So while I was being reviewed for a different position, I had all of these negative write ups that happened to come up as well.  It's things like this that made me feel that I was being worked against.  /  / I enjoyed working with Carrington and would work with the company again. But I would absolutely not work for escrow and regret transferring to that area. They should understand that the way they treat employees has an effect on their performance, attendance, and retention. These things have already been outlined by the executive team, and those are the values I was told the company valued. "
"Specialist,CS,I",I only left Carrington because the distance from my home & the hours I was working was negatively impacting my daughter
RE Sales Agent,I was no longer on the REOteam / And was not receiving leads as I once was. Essentially because of this I asked for a bigger split of 90/10 for the transactions I brought in but was denied. This is why I left though I do love Carringtons as a company.
"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside","Wasn't team work.  Very very negative.  Everyday I felt beat down, I was slowly building a pipeline and it was never good enough, needed more, more more.  Well when you are feeling beat up you cant produce.  I need a positive atmosphere.    I love the co Carrington and some of the products.   It seems they weren't able to listen.  I wasn't gone a week and they gave a top producer my lead I was working for over 2 months - I begged to get them signed up and they wouldn't let me.  Then they assigned her to one of their ""favorites"" in the office.  Also, needed help with products and all I was told was ""check the matrix"" never a consult.   Carrington is a great co otherwise.   Best of luck :)  /  / Thank you for the opportunity to work with you! :) "
RE Sales Agent,"The office was to far unable to make it to the meeting,"
RE Sales Agent,"Lack of support for one. In addition, I was told that I'd receive foreclosure listings, I got 1, which was overpriced and won't sell. Regarding my own listings, why would I split the commission w/ Carrington when you've done nothing for me and are unable to help me."
"Tech,Building Maintenance","I felt  unappreciated a lot of times, over worked at times because it felt there wasn't a good work/ home balance. With everything I've done didn't  prove in the last 2 years why a  raise was in order rightfully so. Also I felt my department didn't fight to keep me around if they really wanted me to stay. the whole  Morale of the department changed when Brian  Gordon came on board and not in a good way. I love Clay and Dennis and enjoyed my time there but I had to move on at the moment hopefully things will get better."
"Coord,Closing","I was a part time full time employee for 16 months, which meant no holiday pay or vacation. I worked long hours and weekends. My medical condition could not handle the long hours and the stress that is related to the position, They need to hire more closers not increase our portfolio. We depended on other departments and vendors to do our job efficiently but they cant seem to do there job correctly for us to process the closing which takes double time per file."
RE Sales Agent,"Well first off, I didn’t want to leave because I love Maria Zuniga. I respect, admire and trust her. She is extremely knowledgeable and an excellent source to agents. I left because I’d like to manage my clients’ properties and Carrington doesn’t allow agents to engage in property management so I had to make the difficult decision to leave. Should that not pan out, I’ll be back, or go wherever Maria is :) "
"Specialist,CS,I","I was a part time representative. management didn’t want to work with my schedule for the next 30 days.

"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","There were a few reasons, one mainly was the compensation....I felt completely disrespected when I found out individuals were getting hired at a higher pay rate hourly than I was with less experience.....especially when I have sacrificed so much for carrington....I’m talking 2...3...4 dollars an hour difference than what I was paid....it was a complete slap in the face.... /  / Secondly it was your attendance policy....I was stuck on a cruise boat in sept during Hurricane Irma and I received an occurrence for that....REALLY?!? /  / Several other issues as well from supervisor mistreatment to favoritism"
RE Sales Agent,"I didn't get enough value for the commission split portion that you received. I thought you would provide more leads and listings that I could profit from receiving. I gave you a lot of non-productive, non-income generating work but I did not receive any value or profit from my work. 99% of my transactions were agent generated. I anticipated that I would get more value from the company."

"Analyst,Treasry,Faclty,Sr",Having 12 hour days on a consistent basis as well as having to each lunch at my desk while working in order to keep up with the workload that was set to me. Also the workload was skewed between new hires and when I stated that this is a lot of work to my team lead nothing was done
RE Sales Agent,"Carrington was not offering what I needed. The tools were outdated and did not work well together. I also wanted MORE in my business. I work very hard and I brought 98% of my own business to Carrington. By the time you implemented the new tools it was too late. My goal is to get business in a higher price range and a lot of the time I did not feel supported in that. I was with you for about 3 1/2 years. Moving companies is not something I take lightly. Our focus was not in the same direction. /  / Also, I NEVER expected assets, I saw that as icing on the cake. But what you taught us compared to what was expected was awful. The chart says one thing the process is different. It's not clear...instruction needs to be more streamlined and updated frequently.  I also felt assets were distributed unfairly. If I have PROVEN to you I do good business and 98% of my closings were from my own efforts then I should have been considered for more. Yes, I know numbers are down in that area but I still say if you get five, give them to the five who work their butts off. /  / Too many different platforms. Boomtown was awful. I know you no longer have it, but my clients hated it. Half the time you could not send clients listings from there to keep them in the system because the links were broke. Called many times on this with no success. I'd be so upset when my clients would send me stuff on Redfin. Our company should have been that good with the tools! /  / The lead system was awful. I never closed one lead. I worked the heck out of them too, but toward the end I could have cared less because I felt they were bogus so why waste my time. /  / Meetings needed to have more ""MEAT"" in them.  /  / I enjoyed my time with Carrington. I do not want this to seem all negative because it is not. However my decision to move was a really hard one for me to make because I love Maria (Long Beach) but ultimately I have goals and dreams and I could not reach them there.

"Admin,Entps CRM, Lead",Had to care for parents and did not qualify for leave.
RE Sales Agent,Many different reasons!! 
"Coord,Vendor Relations",CHS was acquired by another company and I was not chosen to be a part of the new company. So my position was terminated.

"Coord,Field Services,II","I did not leave. I was laid off, and then not hired by the other department."
RE Sales Agent,"no communication, seemed like nobody cared, very poorly managed  Tampa office."
RE Sales Agent,"SUPPORT:  I have a full time job and trying to start real estate in the evenings and weekends.  There are no face-to-face meetings offered to me, as there are to day time agents.  I have not received any personal emails or phone calls from my Broker to how I am doing, to set goals, work on a plan to meet my goals or to provide any other bit of coaching.  Yes, there are webinars and videos.  However, how do I implement without the support? /  / THINK OUT OF THE BOX:  There is a huge group of agents out there who want only to work part time, perhaps.  You can grow Carrington exponentially by offering a mentor program to an agent to lead training and coaching on the weekends and evenings.  If not, your are agents probably consist of retirees, stay at home moms, or spouses of wealthy households.  Return on invested time is slow in real state if there is no support.   /  / COMMUNICATION:  What is the Broker's system to maintain communication with all the agents?  It should be weekly monitoring and support.   /  / THE RIGHT WAY:  I spoke extensively to the Broker on the phone before signing up with a new company.  I receive daily/weekly messages from the Broker and his leaders to ensure my start up success.  Since transferring to another Broker, I now have met my mentor and discussed immediate actions.  I have been given rental leads.  I have a technology system, but, with plenty of support.  I have a quarterly training schedule of modules online to watch at my own pace.  I also have support from the group providing the modules.  There are live training sessions that truly would entice me to take a day off from my full time job to attend.  All this in the first week!  Love it! /  / Therefore, offering things agents don't need or can't use will off course result in ""non participation.""  I am not completely new to real estate, I just needed someone to guide me weekly.  The year before signing with Carrington, I closed a rental with my friend.  I showed homes to potential buyers and worked with a Broker in another county from afar.  When I interviewed with Mr. Rodriguez, I told him I needed more support to get a good business started and sustained.  He said they would be there for me.  I have never even sat down with him to discuss yearly goals.  My only support from that office was with another agent, John Baltz.  Although he was available most of the time to answer questions for me, he was not there to help me build a business.  I feel I have wasted money on association dues, Supra key and BOX, as I have never left the STARTING LINE.  "
"Analyst,Research&Rcvy,II",Pay is very low.
"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside",I am very grateful for my time at Carrington.  Everyone was supportive and encouraging. /  / I experienced a significant decline in volume and accepted a position as an LOA. 
"Specialist,FC,I","My family and I are relocating to Indiana. I tried my best to transfer, however Westfield office didn't have my position. I will definitely apply once I'm settled in and can work with set schedule since I have small children."
"Specialist,DefaultMIClaim",I had a family issue that requires me to move which would put me too far to commute for work. If Carrington had offered a way for me to work from home part time I would have stayed with the company.
"Specialist,Tax&Insurance",I left Carrington because I could not stand to work with management anymore. My supervisor and team lead were great! but manager and VP are the worst to their employees especially  when something went wrong or if their just in a mood altogether.  Also Carrington does not have a balanced setting for their employees. Drive was to long for me to keep putting up with things. 
RE Sales Agent,Lack of innovative and beneficial training.  / Not the right energy from the Broker.
"Specialist,RecordsMgmt",Had a medical condition.
"Specialist,CS,I","I went through training, and on the second week of training I was hospitalized and missed. I reached out to Mayra, the trainer, to ask if there was another class I could sit in on. Even if it wasn’t for a few weeks. She told me she would check and get back to me. I never heard back. Then I got a phone call from a woman in HR and I attempted to call and left a message and never got a response. So I waited around for 2 weeks to get a phone call or email back and no one reached out to me. I am in the process of writing corporate a letter when I received this email. I hope that they learn to keep better communication in the future with future employees because I was really looking forward to working at Carrington. "

RE Sales Agent,Career change to nursing 
RE Sales Agent,"There was absolutey no support. within the office in Newport News ,VA. . I tried to contact. the manager to get any support as a agent but my phone calls were never returned. Cor a real estate agent. that just joined with there was absolutely no consideration to offer me any support at Carrington Realty."
RE Sales Agent,No support from broker in MD area. No return calls from questions I asked.
RE Sales Agent,Lack of broker availability and broken promises. I'm now a managing broker and I'm doing it right. Glad I had this opportunity to give feedback considering I left 3 years ago and never heard from anyone. 
RE Sales Agent,I’m a new agent with no clients need help getting some and was give leads
RE Sales Agent,Family obligations
RE Sales Agent,I was told that I was being dropped for not producing. I did not quit. I also couldn't pay the association fees at this time. Thanks. / 
RE Sales Agent,I didn't have the funds to pay for my HAR/MLS/SUPRA KEY.  I BECAME ILL AND NEEDED TO USE THOSE FUNDS.  I WAS TRYING TO TRANSITION FROM HUMAN RESOURCES CUSTOMER SERVICE BACK TO FULL TIME REALTOR.  Never actually started with Carrington. 
"Specialist,DefaultMIClaim",i am moving out of state.
RE Sales Agent,"I didn't know I was let go until I received this email. I have been completely inactive, so I'm sure that's why they dropped me. It would have been nice to be told though.... I won't bad talk Carrington, but I won't refer them either. "
RE Sales Agent,I was not able to access the office unless someone else was already there. Access code given did not  work and no one cared to fix it for me.  Also I like to work from office not from home. Did not find the office adequate to do so. 
RE Sales Agent,I was not getting paid for the time and effort of work required to manage the REOs.  The commission split and reduced percentage on REOs was just too little for the amount of work required.  I am seeking to return to doing REOs and have updated my equator account.  
RE Sales Agent,i couldn’t afford to work on commission only and looking for a salaried job. 
RE Sales Agent,I didn't leave Carrington.  I was told I had to leave because Carrington does not hire part time agents.
RE Sales Agent,I have no network and I  am not able to invest more money into advertising/ marketing.  However Carrington has good support for the agent but not supporting property management. Since I have this PM experience I am going to focused on that because  it will  not require so much financial investment . Just making adjustment bace on financial calculation.
RE Sales Agent,I wanted to make more money in commercial real estate
RE Sales Agent,I’m not currently well.
RE Sales Agent,Did not get local support as a new agent. Felt lost. All of the training was in Houston and I'm in Dallas.
RE Sales Agent,I left because my new broker had a lot more to offer ecen in the split.  The technology will blow you away and I like the atmosphere and the broker attentiveness to get you going instead of another license on the wall.  Carrington offer a lot to but don't change with technology.  I don't think they were fair in the Two's.  Given to two of the same people always.
RE Sales Agent,"To start my own brokerage because to split a commission with Carrington did not make sense for me as they were not the ones bring in my sales.  Also, got tired of trying to always figure out how to get something to work with Carrington.  They always had ideas, plans, etc but I could not even get put into the systems correctly and it just became frustrating trying to get anything done.  "
"Analyst,DefaultMIClaims",Retirement 
RE Sales Agent,"I didn't leave Carrington, I just was too busy because I'm a single mom, no family around, young children, work already as a Massage Therapist. I think I have to wait until my kids are older. "
RE Sales Agent,I have a full time position in the financial industry and the transition into real estate did not occur as I had planned. 
RE Sales Agent,"No support. Had a high value altisource listing, got all info from buyers agent regarding closing. Took 2.5 weeks to get paid. Had BPO and CMA work from altisource took4 months and dozens of emails to get paid.  / What your compliance department asks for at closing is ridiculous, I’ve been embarrassed numerous times at a closing by asking for these items. Honestly you fired Deann Gladwell and ruined that office. "
RE Sales Agent,I had a baby and am not ready to go back to work as a full time agent. 
RE Sales Agent,Too far from my house. Weekly meetings. Holiday dress up parties. Wasn't given nearly the amount of leads I was promised. 75% split but nothing much in return. Boomtown platform hard to use. Company is changing everything too much. Xome program hard to understand and market. New agent training call malfunctioned. Slow response from tech support person.  
RE Sales Agent,I was a new agent with no experience and training wasn't provided. 
RE Sales Agent,My new office is very closed to where I live
"Specialist,CS,I","The management is complete crap. They talk down to people on a regular basis. Duggan just likes to hire his friends and promote his friends. They (duggan and vitt) just let Liz do whatever she wants whenever she wants. Liz is the most unprofessional person I have ever met in my life. When I started out everything was great and I loved working there. Now I wouldn’t tell my worst enemy to work there. The only sups that are left are only there because they kiss the right asses, you got rid of the ones that knew how to do the job effectively. "
"AE, Wholesale",Basically I ran out of time.  My $2500 in monthly comp was ending and I needed more time.  I was away from the wholesale industry for a number of years and it was taking longer than I anticipated to get my business up and running. 
RE Sales Agent,I took on a full time job with a medical facility with serious phone restrictions. We weren't informed of these restrictions until after signing on.
"Manager, Branch","""Serving the underserved"" is a philosophy that I do not do well.  My skill set is precisely opposite - that of developing relationships that refer high credit score, jumbo borrowers."
"Coordinator,DefaultInvc","In the last two weeks I have felt bullied, harass and ignored. From habitual emails  detailing what I was doing wrong in a condescending matter. I would be pulled into one on one meetings after being in department meetings going over the same issues as if I were the only one with comprehension problems. I expressed my frustration and how the new work load, the training and training material was not sufficient to be successful in my job.  This particular part has been going on throughout the year. I also feel that the management team has ignored the complaints from the majority of the team. This is a small portion of why I left. "
RE Sales Agent,Relocated to another state
"Loan Officer, Retail II","My Physician recommended I take a 3 day (FMLA is available) leave of absence.  I notified Jolene of these three days on Monday November 20th and the last day would be Wednesday the 23rd.  When I returned to work, I read an email that my Jason Dickey loan wanted to switch the loan around from a VAIRRRL to a cash-out loan.  The entire purpose of the first loan was to place himself, wife and 2 daughters into a better financial position so that in 7 years, he could buy 30 acres of land in Tennessee.  Starting the refinance also started his search for land in TN.  He found a great deal and decided to de a cash out transaction to purchase the TN land!!   I was really excited for him! /    Jolene, my boss, notified me that since I was on medical leave she gave the loan to someone else.  I gave the Doctors letter to Jerry Kitchens when I returned which specifically states the three days leave I told Jolene about. /   In addition the robbery of commissions, I asked Jolene who to contact to get the correct forms to my Physician.  She told me Jerry Kitchens and didn't provide me with a phone number.  After calling corporate 5 times to get the right Jerry on the phone I spoke with someone directly in HR who said to just bring the Physicians note in and I will be fine.  I also found Lori Grigg on Linked In and she helped me out and got everything squared away. /   The next night I got an email from Jerry Kitchens asking why I didn't contact him and why was I a no show on that day to work? /   I understand this is an enormous company and sometimes the chain of communication isn't the bests.  I get it. /  /   But to have my $190,000 loan stolen from me because I was not available at 5:30pm on my last day of leave of absence makes me sick. /  /   Never mind the 7 other employees I referred to Carrington."

"Mngr,InsideSales,Retail",No contact with me ever.  I felt left out and ignored and final straw was being passed over for branch manager at Murrieta. 
"Specialist,Disbr,CTS","my spouse transferred to another state. Before leaving the Company I was looking to transfer to another department due to my manager who was very unprofessional and showed favoritism and was not easy to get along with and who needs mgr training. My Manager would not promote within the department when there was an interest from other employees, instead the Manger would go outside of Carrington to interview for the 2 positions in the department. When I had my initial interview with my Manager I was told that everyone on the team was crossed trained....which was not true she would not cross train even if it was for month end which I had asked numerous of times if I could be trained on other duties within the department and I was told NO.... I have discussed my Manager's unprofessionalism to the VP of the department who has had several complaints of the managers unprofessionalism. A person should not have to come to work having anxiety due to the work conditions.  I would come back to Carrington at a drop of a hat as long as I do not have to work for Debbie Hanson!!!. she is a terrible Manager!! I also did not like the fact that Carrington did not contribute to the Employee 401K plan that is a reason why I choose to opt out of the 401K plan, I can get a 401K plan on my own and contribute to it directly. I have never worked at a company who did not contribute any amount."
"Manager, Retail Lending","The reason I left is the Senior Mgr level and the way they run a business is the worst I have ever seen. I have been in the Banking/Mortgage industry for over 27 yrs. and have never experienced leadership in that culture. To be expected to Drill, Drive and Unmotivate employees to perform on a daily basis was creating a culture of Negativity and a Culture of Disappointment as a leader. I have never been in a MGR position that required to NOT have Work/Life balance. I drove 2 hours a day on a good day to work and had no problem with that but when My Leader constantly complained that I wasn't working 14-16 hours M-F as well as Saturday's. I have Managed 100 employee's at one time and never had a complaint. You cant expect People to work for you and give 110% everyday if you drive them to Death and tell them they are just not good enough and  this is kind of atmosphere that the Sr. leadership would tell SM to manage in. / Critism everyday is not a Work place environment just isn't the Career path for anyone. Changing employess Comp Plan 3 times in a yr and make promises to the employees that the COMPANY will take care of them and don't deliver. SR. Management telling the Staff that we are not good at closing loans and we are not going to staff to handle the volume. I am and always been a Purchase Loan officer with Builders and Agents and missing closing dates is a Disaster and couldn't allow my 20 plus years of building relationship to let go down the drain. the real sad thing is that Carrington wasn't like this when I was hired. Beginning of 2017 with Sr. MGMT change is when the Culture changed to the Negative. that is all I will say on that. I really enjoyed building relationships with the staff and believe me they are good folks. "
"Specialist,PostFC,I","Had decided to stay home to care for my children.

"Auditor,Brnch/Intrnl, Jr.","I was hired on October 2nd and left at my desk for 3 weeks with 12 pieces of audit training materials and a Carrington University training semenair that only took a couple days to complete. Lon Lewis was on vacation and also while he was there only interacted with me for 6-8 hours in one month of employment during a few meetings with another new auditor. On Nov 1st, I was told by my Supervisor that I should not have spoken up during a team meeting we had about scheduling each member to drive to a different location at 3am for a walkthrough audit. I only mentioned that I should check with Lon my Supervisor first to ensure that I'm following HR guidelines, since I was the only hourly employee present at the meeting. First, I wasn't sure how I would clock in before working in Anaheim.  Then, I also needed to be sure that I was allowed to drive on the clock and if that was against company policy. I told Lorraine who didn't seem to like a new employee telling her that I needed to check with my Supervisor first.  / After leaving the meeting, I immediately walked into Lon Lewis's office to ask him those questions.  / He told me to request VPN access from IT and to clock in on my laptop.  After leaving Lon's office, I walked up to Lorraine and told her that I will get VPN access to clock in and that I got the go ahead from Lon to go to Anaheim for a walkthrough. She must have complained to Lon because I was called into his office the next day and he asked me why I would say anything..   a new person in the team meeting should not speak up. Why i would even say anything was beyond he's understanding. He told me that it doesn't look like I will be a good fit, and that I will most likely be terminated. He said that he would think about it and let me know the next day if he was going to terminate my employment.  / I felt that I was only trying to abide by company policy and having my livelihood and career taken away over that was very unreasonable. I asked to resign if he's decision was to terminate my employment."
"Specialist,Special Servc.", Incentive structure was too low with too many delays from vendors that limited earning potential.

"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl","I Had neurosurgery on my neck three years ago.  I have disc degeneration that required a section to be fused.  Working at my desk extending my neck to look at the computer screens and reach for the phone 8-9 hours a day was so damaging to my neck that the neurosurgeon said he would have to fuse two more sections....it was not a matter of ""if"" but rather ""when"".  He said that if I continue extending my neck in that same environment I would need surgery most likely in the next 6 months.  But if I get out of that environment I might with some physical therapy be able to get several years of mileage out of my neck before they need to do a second surgery."
"Underwriter,RetailBrch,Sr",My family needs me right now as support and I could not take care of family and work. I felt I could not focus and give 100% to cms at this time. I am stil not sure I made the right decision but it is one I had to make at this time 
RE Sales Agent,I decided to slow down and enjoy my retirement years a bit more and never seem to get going in SC.
RE Sales Agent,Because I work full time and the expectations that I placed on myself made me feel as if I would not be able to fully take advantage of all the services for agents you have tooffer.
"Specialist,CS,I",The company doesn’t care about their workers and most of all do not care about their customers which is sad i don’t know how many times i had to listen to a customer suffer or go crazy because of something management refused to fixed because they just wouldnt feel like putting in the work it became such a stressful environment. I always was going through so much with HR where they wouldn’t approve my FMLA which was doctors orders.
"Assistant,Escrow","An opportunity arose for me to further my knowledge in Title, in addition to allowing me to pursue my academic studies. "
"Mngr,Closing Ops, CTS",Didn't feel that upper management had a true grasp of the differences between retail and institutional. Lack of Texas specific understanding if property laws made it difficult to get support to close transactions.  Retail is high customer service and time sensitive. Attention to detail on exam is critical as well.  Several items were missed in exam and I had to fight to fix and try to keep customer happy.    I think everyone wanted to try it out bit not commit 100%
RE Sales Agent,My real estate license expired. 
"Loan Officer, Retail",With all due respect you did not send me a message last week to respond as last week is when 11/01/2017 was the my last day of work.
"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl","When I went to work for Carrington, it was my understanding that I would be generating all categories of loan product. I felt that my contacts and background as a previous Realtor would help me with loan generation. Soon after I started the center was converted to Streamline and Full doc teams; I was put on the Streamline team. Everything changed after that. Showing up to work and being present was not rewarded, only the number of loans being generated. If you had a million dollar pipe it didn't matter if that amount came from 3 loans, it had to be x number or you were written up. Every month my fear of not having 9 loans required was causing me stress, but what really did it for me was not a result of my personal experience, but when I heard a manager tell an associate who had just bought a house and was needing a week off to move, that she just better have her quota met. What if you get sick, can't be sick unless you quota is met, a family emergency, better have your quota met. If Ray wants to know why employee morale is so low he needs to talk to his employees one on one. I chose to move on although I appreciate the licensing and training that another company will now get the benefit of"
"AE, Whlsale, Inside",Found the process of closing loans with wholesale to be too difficult.  Also was concerned with reduction in compensation.
"Auditor,Branch/Internal",Underpay and poor bonus pay 
"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside","I wasn’t altogether satisfied with the processing of my loans.  I liked the processor but felt that she would over process and underwrite the loan to the point that the loan wouldn’t close on time and the items called for were more than a DU findings required.  In some cases, a portion of the required items weren’t even used or a factor in the approval or closing conditions.  I don’t feel that I am alone in this matter."
"Specialist,BK CS, I",Severely understaffed in the bankruptcy call center.The overwhelming workload with any upper management support.
RE Sales Agent,"well every since i joined i never met the Broker, there was always one excuse or another about his whereabouts. never met any other agents from the office. also, even the Irvine officer, there is no one ever there even during prime business hours. if i wanted a virtual real estate company i would join EXP realty. clearly that is not what i was looking for. "
RE Sales Agent,"My goal is to become great on the phone, meeting people and gathering leads. The last meeting I went to I was under the impression that phone prospecting was not going to be the focal point of management support. I was basically told to do with the sphere of influence way or find my own way.  So, I've since hired on with a company who supports phone prospecting, role playing, and Mojo dialing system training as a team. I've been with the company for 3 weeks and I've got two signed contract s and one buyer from one of those contacts. "
"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl",Upper management tone def to the strong performers in the office.  Attitude of everyone is just a commodity and is replaceable.  SVP and EVP regarding comp plan changes as if it was done as a favor to the sales force all the while knowing that it was starting to become an issue and possible violation of consumer finance laws.  
"Specialist,PostClose,CTS",Was offered a lateral position move with better pay
"Loan Processor,Rtl,FD,I",I got an offer I could not turn down with larger salary & benefits. 
"Specialist,Bankruptcy,II",Was in a bad car accident.
RE Sales Agent,"I might have possibly broken my back in an accident, I can move, but not without a lot of discomfort, I do not believe I could be what or do what  John needed me to do, I'm going to see my orthopedic surgeon, chiropractor, do physical therapy, and just heal. So I thought it best to leave for the time being and wait and see."
RE Sales Agent,"I left because I saw the opportunity with eXp Realty. Osnat has been great. Exp offers a different type of program that I am more comfortable with. I see that eXp gives me the option to grow my own team, collect revenue from my team and have the company do all the training and hiring process. They also offer Stock incentives. It is cloud based and every agent is an owner. I can recruit agents from any state I wish. I am currently building my team. The lead generation software works very well and Kunversion CRM. "
"AE, Wholesale","I needed more training on products and the programs.  I’ve been out of the business over nine years.  A-paper and govt programs are all new to me.  If I had been working out of a center where other AEs and my sales manager were based, I could freely ask questions and get immediate help. What would have been beneficial to me from the beginning, attend a live training class working with the computer programs with training loans in the system.  I received conflicting information from IT and training webinars.  Also, selling over the phone is new to me vs. visiting broker shops face to face.  It would have been good to have scripts from successful AEs to use and practice and develop my own with my personality.  I was on an excellent team with a great Regional Sales Manager—wish I could have worked directly out of the Dallas office being so new.  I am now with a company that is located in my city.  The entire processing/closing/compliance/underwriting teams are located right in my office.  I am able to learn and develop quickly to bring me up to speed to be successful faster.  I didn’t want to leave Carrington as I believe this was an awesome opportunity.  I just didn’t feel I could be as successful with my limited knowledge.  I hope you will consider me again in the future."
"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl",When I was being hired I was advised that Carrington Would be bringing on a  huge amount of leads that they needed coverage for and I would be able to close more loans with a lower base salary quickly and get paid sooner. The leads I was given where leads that had been worked over by previous loan officers for years based on the feedback of customers on the phone. The leads also provided in my final weeks were low as 4.25% and eventually my final week 3.75%. Also I was advised that we were only lowering the VA loans by .50 of the current rate which meant that all Veterans were not being treated by getting the same rate. I do everything honestly and with integrity. I asked to be moved to a production aspect instead of a sales position 2 weeks prior as I was not happy with the current FHA streamline and VA portfolio I could not sell due to unfair pricing. I never heard back from management. The final week I got more leads of 3.75% which meant another week of not being able to put loans on the books so I could get a decent paycheck. Plus I have been in Banking for 20 years in the mortgage industry and I have never seen such a complicated process to get a loan into processing. Sorry
"Loan Processor,Rtl,FD,I",I left due to the commute. I also left due to being written up when I didn’t hit my number of loans when it wasn’t my fault due to Fall our. 
"Tech,Desktop Support,II",I left because I was not happy with my job performance. I was not doing a great job and I was not happy with my job duties. In all I was just burnt out from answering calls for 4 or 5 hours a day.
RE Sales Agent, I live in Redding California and my original intention was to go to Sacramento California to work. That was not something I could make manifest and I needed more working agents to be around. I didn't have any resources of my own and there was no agents I could borrow signs from Until  I could purchase my own and I just needed more person to person training and activities so I went with Caldwell banker here in Reading. If I'm ever able to move to Sacramento to work like I want to I would love to come back to Carrington because I think you're a really good company. 
"Specialist,DefaultMIClaim",The leadership of the department I worked in was very unprofessional. There was not enough work to keep me busy and when I said something to management she said it wasn’t here job to babysit me. Huge insult! I was treated differently than the other employees  and when brought to someone else’s attention within the company it was completely ignored. I even requested a department transfer but not granted because I had not been there 6 months. Horrible experience with this company.
RE Sales Agent,"Unintended,  had an auto accident and my license expired.  Sent in the required CE to the Realestate Commission.  Reinstated "
RE Sales Agent,"I did not know I left the company until I received your email, then, tried to log into my account on Carrington site and was not able to... I contacted the IT customer service and was told that I am not in active status and need to contact my broker in PA. I texted John yesterday. As of now, I have not received his responce yet. I would assume that John would at least have a courtesy to talk to me before terminating my license with Carrington RE in Pensylvania...  Currently, I am working under Chantel Ray RE in Virginia and taking broker license classes. I used to work for Carrington in VA too but left because I lost a confidence in broker and senior leadership, plus, other company offered a better platform, support and split of commissions."
"Specialist,Loss Draft",I was on disability for anxiety and depression for one year since 09/14/2016. My doctor gave me a release to go back to work on 10/10/17 but don't feel like I am ready to go back to work. CMS HR told me that the only way I will be terminated /separated from CMS is if I resigned. So I turned in my resignation effective 10/10/17. 
"Specialist,CS,I",I didn't feel valued as an employee the 2 managers in customer service are a joke and don't know what they are doing half the time. It seems Carrington can't hold on to the good ones they all quit.
RE Sales Agent,For me it is always about growth opportunities. I evaluate myself and my Broker to see if what was once a good fit still remains. It's all about relevancy not only in the industry but for me personally. Carrington has been a very good company and by far the best of all the Brokers I have worked for. I appreciate the opportunity
RE Sales Agent,Nothing bad about Carrington. I just decide to go back to property management.
RE Sales Agent,I left Carrington because I started an insurance career and can't have dual business at the same / time.
"Rep,CustomerResearch,CMS",Found better paying job
RE Sales Agent,I felt I was misslead in the recruitment process.
"Analyst,Investor Rprtng",I received an offer from a company that is in a different industry.
"Specialist,Lock Desk,I","I worked very hard to come to this company after hearing good things from employees at Carrington at one time. I heard about growth opportunities and how the company was expanding quickly. I came in with high hopes. The VP I interviewed with had a character of enthusiasm and positivity and I can say that the first interview I had with him was one of the best I had in my life. There was constant connection between what I was looking for and what was being offered. I was exstatic to become part of a rapid growing company.  / Upon accepting the position I was told there would be training for the GNMA Pooling Specialist position and there was. The only problem was that training was informal and was scattered to the point of confusion. I came in at a time where the process of pooling was half way through which tells me that planning to hire was not thought through because not only was I not able to put my two weeks in at my previous job, but I felt rushed to start on 10/19/2015 just to start in the middle if the pooling process. Training material was not provided and I actually had to come up with a training guide myself in order to have some kind of information guide to help me with the procedures. / About 2 months into my position I began assisting the Lock Desk as they were extremely behind in completing locks and answering daily emails from brokers and loan officers. I volunteered to assist them when I could and would stay an hour or two for OT. I thought the problem was that the number of requests were too kuch for the number of representives. I later found out the real reason, which I will touch on later in my survey. / About 6 months into my position as a GNMA Pooling Specialist, I was working on a trade by myself and unbeknownst to me one of the representatives that emailed me the information that I needed to send the data to GNMA and ither investors. The data given to me happened to be incorrect and the info was sent to the incorrect investor, this error could have potentially caused a loss for the company. The VP came to my desk to ask which investor the data was sent to when I completed my process. After reviewing the info and confirming that it was i deed se t to the wrong investor, the VP gripped his head with both hands and telled ""F*CK!!!"" in frint of me and everyone that was crammed in suite 140 at the time. Every representative's immediate reaction was to turn to me with a shocked and confused look on their face. I felt disrespected and shocked that this person I interviewed with had not been the same person since the day I began working and now I see this side of him that I never saw coming. Seconds after his reaction, he turns away from me and walks away towards his office and he SLAMS!! His fist onto a file cabinet in his way to his office. It was at this point where I felt very uncomfortable and confused. I completely lost my train of thought and lost any hope that this company would be the company I would build my career with. In ither words, I began to regret ever jumping onboard with Carrington. The trust was no longer there and I disliked being in the same suite with this unstable person. I feared losin my job the next day and the day after that and the day after that. All I could think if now was getting myself out of this unhealthy situation. / 3 weeks after the incident I began applying for different positions within the company and I had an i terview set up soon after. The interview went well but I have no doubt that the VP I was under had something to do with interfering with the possibility that I would even be considered. I only say this because the VP I was under quickly iffered for me to move to the Lock Desk as I already knew the function/job. It would also benefit the department because they would not have to spend time looking fir someone to train ir better yet soneone that would be willing to take the job. I was looking for a raise and a better position due to the circumstance of getting myself out if this unhealthy situation. / I made the decision to join the lock desk as I was denied the position I applied for in QC. I inly took the position because I would not be un the VP and I knew the job already. As much as I tried to get a raise for my much needed family, Carrington nor the VP nor the Lock Desk manager agreed to a raise, not even a $0.50 raise. All they offered was access to more OT. I was in a bind, either stick to pooling under an unstable VP or take a position under a new manager to do what I already know what to do. Of course I didn't want to work with the VP so I take the leap. Mind you, working at the lovk desk was not the reason I came to Carrington. / After workin at the lock desk for a tear and a half, I can tell you that I would never work in this type of position again in my life, nor would I recommend it for someone that wants to grow in a company. Some would call this a dead end job and I would say that some is correct. Another thing. i noticed is that there is a whole lot if favoritism that happens at the Lock Desk. You have those working in that department that have been with the company since it was in Santa Ana. Earlier in this survey I mentioned that I found out the real reason why there was so many locks and emails at the end of the day. Those same reps that have been with the company for many years are extremely lazy. They want to get hard working, fast working reps to join the team so that the seniority reps can have a blast surfing the web on the computer, surf the social media interwebs in their phone, take 2 hour breaks where they can have family members log them back in (yes, I said family members because they work together), so they can take 2.5 hour lunches, so they can take an hour lunch to pick up food and sit at their desk for another 45mins to eat the food and so they can go play pool in the break room or shoot sone hoops at the basketball court. These are the same reps that will hang out until 6pm when they finished doing emails at 4:30pm but they dont want to touch the 35-40 locks that are left over becuase they are too good for locks. They would rather do any one of the activities that I mentioned above and will rely on the rest of the workers to complete the locks. Makes me wonder how the VP would react if he found out about this loss, would he react the same way he did with me?... / In conclusion, I can go in forever, I have to say thatCarrington was bot what I expected. I am disappointed not only in the company but at myself for putting up with the nonsense. I expected a professional environment buu it was everything but professional. It felt like I was going back in time with this company. My voworkers made me feel like I was in High School all over again. No sense of professionalism and no one wanted to share a bit of knowledge. It felt as if no o e wanted to share anything with you out of fear that you could potentially learn too much and take their position away at some point. Did I feel like there was growth opportunity in this company? Absolutely NOT! I feel cheated and although I spoke to HR about my experience with the VP after a few months (only because I was scared to lose my job over telling someone, mind you I had never experienced anythi g like this in my time working), I felt like the inly thing that made me feel better was that I acrually had the chance to talk to soneone about it because HR did nothing about the situation even after emailing them to. Sadly, I'm not even sure if anything will be do e about this after I send this to you all. I just hope the next person with the desire to grow in a company like Carrington, does not get cheated out of an opportunity to do so becuase of someones inability to see the desire and true skill that they may have in their team. I spent many many hours doing OT and ireplaceable hours away from my children/family to make sure the locks were done everyday. A lot of time spent that my family and I will never get back. / As a result if all of this, I decided that I had given the mortgage industry my last shot. I decided to go into a different field forcefully for the better of my health, mental stability and for my family. I was tired of dealing with the stress that this company put forth. / Please excuse my spelling and/or grammar as I am typing this on my cell phone. If you made it this far i. Reading, I would like to thank you for your time."

"Manager,RtlLnd,Prtfl","We were consistently hounded about having clear cut goals four or direct reports, however, that same reciprocation was not given to us as managers.  I have never in my life been in a position where I did not know from day to day if my team's production was going to be acceptable.  It truly felt like goals were changed on a daily basis making it impossible to give your employees clear cut goals.  And, no matter what you were doing throughout the month it was never enough, nor was it ever good enough in the eyes of senior leadership to warrant a compliment.  As a manager I would easily put in 60+ hours a week and still was made to feel like that was not enough.  "

"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside","ZERO training from management. Management  is too busy working on their own loans to help anyone else with anything. The environment is very toxic, no positive energy, loans are hard to get closed, there is only 1 processor that cannot handle the load she carries, so things are constantly missed, forgotten, or not done. Had to process everything myself, no direction or help whatsoever on loans I was trying to work, unrealistic expectations of sitting in the office every day wasting time and sitting for 8 hours to maybe get 15 minutes of someone's time for some help and clarification. NO leads were given to work or close, even though they were promised,  not aloud to go out and develop any business to get my own leads.  Too much going on to build new hires. No support"

RE Sales Agent,"Your systems are too complicated and the training is very poor. The person who did the orientation training had nothing more to offer than what I could've read on my own online. She sounded very inexperienced. Very slow response from management, sometimes no response. Over-inflated as to what the company has to offer.

"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside","If I had a single complaint about Carrington it would be the constant talk of money in daily emails from our corporate powers.  To me ""to serve the under served"" seem more of a happenstance than an actual goal based mandate.  The constant barrage of email regarding the tenacious nature with which we were impacting our bottom line started to seem greedy and base...it's basically all we talked about in emails I was included in on a corporate scale.  In my experience those things (bottom lines and net operating income) are naturally affected if we serve our clients well, but we never talked about the need to serve our clients well, thusly, Carrington is taking a beating on the internet and everywhere customer service surveys are performed.  In short I got the feeling that people were on to the fact that we don't care, and we never told them we do.  Past that there were few differences between the Carrington vision and my own.  I simply got an offer that was a higher commission rate at a company that has an office 10 minutes from my home as opposed to the hour and a half it would take me to get to Springfield VA.  Couldn't speak more highly about my manager and supervisor, I got an offer from a company that has the same loan products an hour closer (one way) to my home"

RE Sales Agent,"I joined CRES with the hope and expectation that we'd have an office in Staten Island. After several months and with the realization this wasn't happening any time soon, if at all, I joined another brokerage. I never received a single lead, nor were the bank owned properties ever made available to a colleague of mine or to me. On the plus side, I very much enjoyed Seth Lesselbaum for his responsiveness and his just nice-guy persona! Some considerations for your use are these, which I think are logical and practical in general: 1) website should not expect public users to create accounts in order to look around, especially since many sites don't use this discouraging practice and still capture leads; 2) encourage every local office to have a transaction coordinator in order to expedite matters and to have a TC who is well-versed in specific state regulations; 3) evaluate two weeks wait time for commission payments, as it is a bit disconcerting and, frankly, a discouraging factor. Thanks!"
"Loan Officer, Retail","So many reasons.....  I believe management is wholly incompetent.   So many of them have backgrounds in servicing or banking, but not mortgage lending.  And they are unwilling to take the advice of those who may have that necessary experience.  I also believe management is lacking in integrity.  I've had a couple of loans where Carrington made a mistake on the closing of the loan, and then failed to properly remedy the situation, leaving the borrower with a HIGHER payment than when they came to me for payment relief.  I believe Carrington may have illegally set up escrow accounts based on Carrington's ""preferred tax payment due dates in servicing"", rather than using the actual tax due dates based on the tax certificates.  I believe the creation of the ""Carrington loan"" was illegal, as it gave no options to the borrower except for the ""one size fits all"" rate.   I believe Carrington has played favorites, giving the best leads to two select individuals.   I believe human resources did nothing about this, time after time, after having been notified of the situation.  I know with certainty that Carrington management turned a blind eye to the fact that certain loan officers were working many hours off the clock.  I believe hiring in management positions is based on friendships and nepotism, rather than merit.   I believe the company is not willing to put any resources into the company to improve it's systems; it continues to hobble along with an antiquated lead management system, and wholly inadequate phone que system, which penalizes those loan officers who busy themselves making outbound calls, as they should, and putting them last in line for new inbound calls.

RE Sales Agent,"As a new real estate agent who has come on board with Carrington Real Estate Services through the Veterans Program, the expectation of mentorship and training to ensure success is vital. Upon entering this program, I was informed I would have this training and would be ready to succeed in this new career. Coming from 21 years in the military, training is a vital role in everyday operations and was never sub-par. Whether it was new soldiers entering into the armed forces or seasoned soldiers, we had a training program that ensured the success of each soldier. /      I do understand that Carrington Real Estate Services is not a military branch and does not operate as such, however, I would like to bring to the attention of the Broker and Office Managers of the expectations of veterans when you open the doors to bring them in as Real Estate Agents. Veterans expect to have a training program in place that outline in detail starting from the ground up beginning with prospecting, open houses, handling objections, prospect to lead conversion, lead conversion and so on.  I also understand that Carrington Real Estate Services is a very large Brokerage and the Office Managers have a very busy schedule and may not be able to accommodate new agents with this type of training due to the time availability that it takes to conduct training and follow up with each new agent under their scope. /     With that said, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity that Carrington Real Estate Services has provided for me, but I feel that my personal expectations have not been fulfilled with the training requirements and further I do feel as I am failing as a new real estate agent with Carrington Real Estate Services. Failure is and never will be an option for me. As of August 18th, 2017, I am removing myself from Carrington Real Estate Services and will no longer be conducting Real Estate Transactions under the Carrington Real Estate Services (CA) Inc.

It was mentioned to me that upper management turned down the request.  Although, it was offered to me by middle management.    Mean what you say and say what you mean!! Period, no BS."
RE Sales Agent,"Main reason is the multitude of fees.  I spent weeks preparing information and traveling to and from foreclosed properties that were outside of my preferred commute. After lisitng these very low priced properties under 50k and meeting potential leads at the property just to lose the buyer side to a cash investor with another agent and then only receiving 250.00 of the 1250.00 commission which is less than the tax deductible mileage value I would be reporting on my tax returns, it didn't make any sense to continue to working for a company in which it was actually costing me more money than I could make.  All the leads generated from boomtown were related to these listings or other low priced online bidding sites that were 20-30 miles from my home and saw no value in that system to repeat the cycle of working for free.  The lack of personal interest in the BIC, the lack of the ability to interact with corporate with issues and the massive corporate unapproachable environment I felt was the culture of the company, I decided there were better options.  I felt I was somewhat mislead about the opportunity in Fayetteville, not knowing the market and trusting the BICs recommendation to relocate 3.5 hours from SC to pick up all of these foreclosure listings which were nothing but a way for Carrington to save some money on referral fees.  Also somewhat disappointed to discover another agent was hired to share the very few and low priced leads by the agent, not by the BIC.  I thought it was very unprofessional to not have discussed this with me and to give me some notice that another agent would be ""on the team"" in Fayetteville.  I was unable to set up any utility services due to the inability to provide the proper documentation to accounting and not learning about that for over 4 weeks after the properties had gone under contract.  I was unable to find the proper person to assist me within the company on the issue of the utility deposits and status.  A multitude of emails were sent and it was never resolved until I finally received a system generated notice that the request had been declined because an invoice was not included in the request.  The utilitiy companies provided the invoice in the form of an email which I submitted because they didn't have any way to provide an invoice any other way.  Evidently, this wasn't acceptable.  This company is a screwed up mess from the beginning of the most confusing orientation and a multitude of tasks that were very difficult to keep track to the inability to follow up with a PERSON or to even know what person to follow up with. The asset managers, eviction coordinators and other people working on the Equator side were slow to respond and when responding didn't answer questions asked or provided very limited information.  The lack of quality communication is definitely missing.  The company is too focused on recruiting agents than developing agents and trying to create a positive and REWARDING working environment.  The commission schedule is probably the worst I've ever seen in the industry in which I have been in for 17 years!  A phone call for something as important as this survey is for the future of your company would be more appropriate....once again, very impersonal approach."

"Sup,LossMit,Underwriting","Very ""hostile"" and degrading work environment. My managers provided no training or direction, just here, go do this. I have to self train as to Fiserv, AltiPro, etc. When ever I asked management for assistance I would get this scowl of a look like I was bothering them, get short hasty answers never spent any time reviewing my job description , expectations, goals. When I would use my style of management being I had no direction, the employee would complain to management, then I would be told we don't do it that way. When I approached employees who show up late constantly, leave early, standing at other employees desks multiple times throughout the day for not being at their own desk working, I was told this is ""just the culture here"" I came from Fannie Mae where accountability is number one. here it was more of ""we do not want to rock the boat or hurt any ones feelings"" Probably the major factor was being referred to and belittled in manger meetings, I was called ""Grand Pa"", ""old man of the group"" frequently asked my age. If I had another opportunity at Carrington I would consider it, but not in this particular divisions. I have filed for unemployment and shared these concerns with them as well. In addition profanity is used by management regularly and openly, both on the floor and in meetings, especially the ""F"" word and many other swear words, with no concern if hourly or management people around."

"Loan Officer,Brnch,Inside","Carrington is a high pressure sales oriented organization and thats okay.  I think most of the successful retail branch loan officers come with some prior experience either from a bank or other correspondent lender.  The key is they have experience and contacts.  I was brand new to this business segment. I had always been successful in inside sales but Inhad no prior experience, no local support, and no contacts.  All at the same time, I am trying to learn this business remotely and build a referral network to procure loans. And although I am very appreciative for Carrington giving me the opportunity, I personally don't think Carringtonis an organization where you can ""cut your teeth"" (if you will).  Secondly, I think Carrington is cannabizing.  While in the field, I have a wholesale network competing with me and call centers being fed leads (probably from my geographic region as well).  Likewise, the knowledge factor (or lack there Of on my part) was an obstacle. In the end, time was not on my side as Carrington has a production goal (rightfully so).

RE Sales Agent,"I really enjoy working at Carrington Real Estate Cervices, especially by Cindy Davis management, / however I had an offer which I think can be good opportunity for me, so I decided to try."
RE Sales Agent,"I left Carrington because of how long it took to get paid on a deal after it closed.  I did not upload my paperwork immediately because I wasn't sure the deal would go through.  We finally worked everything out and it was headed to closing.  I uploaded the documents I know are required and fullfill the compliance requirement in Texas, so that a CDA could be generated and sent to Title.  I did get notified I had not uploaded the documents in time to get paid at closing, which was fine with me, but the Title company still needed to know where to send the funds.  I asked the Transaction coordinator about sending the title company the CDA, she was extremely rude, in the comments that were email to me and I was offended.  Her behavior was that of a person that was stressed out.  Even when I uploaded the requested documents it tooks days for her to respond and even answer my questions on the process.  Some questions I never got answers to just a name finally of who to ask my questions too.  It took 2 weeks after the file closed to get paid, I will NEVER stay at a company/broker where it takes that long to get paid on a file and I have submitted what I believe is the correct documents needed. /  / My opinion is: / 1.  The role of the Transactiion Coordinator should not be to send all documents to this person.  We are all grown adults, your system should require every agent to upload their own documents and the Transaction Coordinator is to verify.  With all the training Carrington has training on Transaction Point should be a requirement for all agents, so they can upload their own documents. /  / 2.  A checklist should be required on all types of transactions and distributed to agents.  If you don't know what documents are needed for compliance, you stay in a back and forth conversation on what is needed.  I rate Carrington poorly on this.  Some of the documents requested for compliance should not be given to Carrington under no circumstances.  The Buyer pays for their survey and the inspection report, but Carrington wants those documents for free as part of compliance.  I don't think so..those documents do NOT make a file compliant in the State of Texas.   /  / 3.  Compliance should not be a convoluted process.  It should go pretty fast and rather smooth, unless the agent has not done their job.  It should not take a file one month to get through compliance.  Your processes are not efficient.  If I have fought 45 days to get the file closed, I really don't want to fight more with compliance to get paid. /  / 4.  After getting a copy of the CDA and when I had questions about the fees.  I NEVER got an answer even to this day.  I asked what were all the fees that were deducted from my commission.  I have never gotten an answer.  The transaction coordinator did come back after I was paid and sent an email of who I could ask those questions too.  I asked several times before the disbursement with no response from the Broker or the Transaction Coordinator.  This is one of the main reason I left.  If I have to pay money out of commission I want to what and why ahead of time, not after the fact and I can do nothing. /  / 5.  I absolutely loved Dory.  She has great experience and ideas and she wants to see you succeed.  I have no problems in the Broker area.  She was wonderful!! /  / 6.  I do believe the one area Carrington could improve upon is training of the agent.  In order to have a lasting career in Real Estate, agents have to be great Listing agents.  This I find is the greatest asset of Keller Williams.  They teach you how to be a good listing agent and the focus on teaching you how to prospect and make phone calls.  Even tho, Carrington has a niche in the REO market, these are still listings.  Agents are Marketing people focusing on Real Estate.  Not every agent at Carrington will have the opportunity to list one of the Bank owned properties, so they really need to know how to sustain themselves in Real Estate.   /  / I left at the end of the day, because of several things above, but mainly because in order for me to have a lasting career in Real Estate I have to focus on listings, and Keller Williams is the best at that.  They do have more fees, but if at the end of the day, I have learned how to be a productive agent, it was worth it.  The other thing that was important to me was accountability and they have on staff coaches.  I very nice attraction for the full-time agent. /  / Thanks, /  / Stephanie Davis-Lemmons /  /  /  "
RE Sales Agent,"In exchange for giving up the percentage of commission I did, I expected to receive institutional listings to supplement my own transactions.  Because those transactions became far less frequent than in the past due to no fault of my own, and because the struggle to get files through compliance became more than I cared to deal with, I decided it was time to find a better income potential with another firm."
RE Sales Agent,Your training is very bad. The first day i met with the trainer i knew that it was not going to work and i was told i was going to get leads and that was not true. If your company get a better trainer and guarantee leads to me then I might rejoin your company. 
"Loan Processor,Rtl,SL,Sr.",I left due to my immediate supervisor Brenda Mack. She is extremely unprofessional (going out drinking with my peers and discussing her subordinates with my peers in a belittling manner as an example). Also the work life balance did not exist at Carrington. 
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","Carrington is a great company the management is the only thing that needs improvement is management which is Cale sizelove and the team I was on was ok, there need to be random drug testing. Favoritism is also an issue also. "
RE Sales Agent,"My primary reason for originally joining Carrington was for the REO listings since I am very experienced in that area of real estate. The Broker had claimed that there would be REO listings available. That never materialized after one year of being with the company and being told that the distressed market was down. This left me to peruse other options since I do fix & flips myself ans was purchasing distressed properties even though I was being told by the Broker that the distressed market was down. That lead me to believe that distressed properties were being assigned to other agents. So, I chose to leave for another company that also works in the REO/Short Sale field in real estate.    "
"Specialist,Special Servc.","I was a victim of racial profiling. I was not the only one that felt that way. It became more and more of an issue. There are Hispanic people in my department who were allowed to have tattoos showing, but every time mine showed even a little bit, I was corrected on the spot. Not to mention I was written up for having PTSD. I am a disabled veteran and I have episodes where my PTSD so bad it is hard to do everyday functions. I would let me supervisor know that I wouldnt be in because of my PTSD. This is not anything I can control when it happens. All day long the managers and other employees would speak to each other in Spanish just so us non Spanish speaking employees couldnt understand what they are saying. This issue was also brought up to Justin our director. I feel that I was being treated differently because of the color of my skin. "
RE Sales Agent,"Carrington was not very well established here in Denver.  We had a small office that was not suited to bring in clients. There were no computers. There was a copier. It seemed that he corporate office was not very interested in helping the local office to make a good impression or be competitive. Providing some money to get started would have been good.  /  / The training received was good. Webinars were informative. Partnerships for getting listings were disappointing. I spent $1000 on a 30 second video to receive leads from Xome. None ever came.  Working with Carrington Mortgage Services was difficult. None of the closings happened on time. I had one realtor tell me that if he saw any offers from me on other listings he had, he would tell his sellers not to consider it because of Carrington Mortgage Services.  I lost a buyer who went with another agent when they wanted to buy another home because of the bad taste from working with Carrington Mortgage. Overall, I believe Carrington RES could have provided more support for an agency just getting started in a new market."
"Superintendent,RF, Sr.","My counterpart was made to dig trenches for a week because our manager said he was not doing his job, I'm 54 years old and was afraid that if I was made to do that I would hurt my back again,  this same manager screams and puts us all down. "
RE Sales Agent,"The reason I left Carrington was my Broker John Zeigler. I have requested Zip Forms for six months and never he answered about it. Every time I have to do an agreement of sales, I did not have a form or addendum, I have to ask to other realtor to give a copy of the form, erased the company name with white out and the used it. 99.9 % of agents in the Lehigh Valley have online form to do any type of transaction except Carrington agents in the Lehigh Valley. I have to be asking other realtors to send me copy from their company to complete some of my transaction, because my broker could not provided us Zip Forms. Also my real estate license was sent to our office in PA and I asked my broker to send me the other part of my license ( The wallet one) and I got frustrated asking him for three months and he did not put attention to my request. My pocket licence was expired and I needed to have a copy of the new one, I sent him my address there time, several emails and he claimed that he sent it to me, but I never received and even thought I kept telling him that I need my real estate license ( the pocket one, he never send it to me and I felt that he did not care about me anymore and left"

RE Sales Agent,I was looking to do and learn the multi-family commercial side of real estate. You don't offer this plat form and I was in a season where this had just been on my mind too long. My sales dropped and I also wanted an office closer to home and a fresh start. All in that order.
"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl"," I left Carrington because I was presented with an opportunity to do more and to make three times the commission.  It was a great place to work it can be put as simply as this, opportunity  was given to me to take care of my family in an even bigger way and I had to take advantage of it.  Nothing regarding managers or the company made me leave only the rate of pay.  carrington on the retail side was not competitive enough for borrowers that needed a specific loan whether it be adjustable, jumbo or one of the many other products that Carrington does not provide. /  /  My new company is paying me a flat rate that is three times more than Carrington would pay me and this is with no minimum volume or units . /  /  Also in the end Westfield made new rules that we had to work Saturdays if we did not get three sales during the week Monday through Thursday .  I am a father of four daughters and my weekends are the only time that I get ."
"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl","Current business model doesn't allow me to be the producer I wish to be. Better quality of leads to producers who clearly have great work ethics.

Processing staff who is motivated to close deals. Knowledgeable processors...."

"Analyst,Business,Sr., LS","Basically, it came down to growth opportunity. With the change in SDLC, the role of a BA was slowly reducing to being more of a scribe. With many aspects of the role being outsourced to outside vendors or shifted to the product team, it felt like sooner or later this role in the agile development model will become extinct. The natural shift would have been to either move to the product management side or to work on something else. I've noticed that the transition to become a product management would also require much effort and it seem to have negatively affected some relationships for people who have made the change. Mainly that they end up Beverly truly leave the position of a BA to transition into a produce manager, rather take on both responsibilities of the two roles. There's is not a clear definition of the move. So as a BA, your options are limited. "

I went to my local HR representative (this was the 2nd time I had made a complaint to him in which he never followed back up with me) and was basically told that I would be fired or written up if I went to pick up my mother.

This made it very challenging to recruit and keep LOs.  Culture for LOs very ""used car salesman"" like - everything is ""urgent"".  Urgent to get loans in, urgent to get them closed this month.  Repeat (urgently).  I like that everyone is focused on getting loans done, but I find the whole month-end thing arbitrary and ultimately something that will burn folks out.

RE Sales Agent,WAS LOOKING FOR RE INVESTOR AGENT FRIENDLY BROKERAGE.
RE Sales Agent,When I saw your add its says that you have Boomtown  as source of leads but you only get leads after completing three transactions.Three transactions with my SOI I could have have done in about 5 months and I was working on it very seriously.One of it was a very big commercial deal with my very motivated my personal friend.By the time I had completed my three transactions and started getting leads from Boomtown that would have may be taken  another six months or so to cultivate those leads into sale. But I was very motivated about me and the real estate business and wanted to dig in right away but unfortunately it did not happen.One more thing I wanted to mention here is that my broker Usha is a great person and excellent trainer. Your agent pay plan is very good and I may come back after year or so hopefully if it is Ok with you guys.

RE Sales Agent,When Carrington bought bout realty direct I went from working in Oldsmar for broker Dan Depies to working for a broker I respected and admired to two Broker's that made working for warrington unbearable.Russ Laggon  & Adrian Petrilla are the worst brokers I have come in counter with in my 13 years in the business. The final straw was that I have my brokers license & they advertised and hired a broker never giving me the opportunity. I have a finance degree fro St. John's University I took the job at Carrington because I thought there would be room for advancement when realized that was not available I left.
"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl",I felt like a telemarketer. I sat at my desk all day to maybe talk to 3 customers all day. For the customers to tell me that they felt like we were harassing them. And most of the loans that we were doing are not really helping the customer because we are adding the MI for a longer period of time so it truly was not a benefit. Also we are told not to discuss the MI or rate to the customer. It was a very uncomfortable job bugging them. I would feel a lot better if we were actually helping them.
RE Sales Agent,"it was not at all how it was introduced me.  studied many many portals to become a go to REO agent, Carrington constantly wanted more testing take this module take that module with no benifit and quite frankly I was to busy to put that much time into something that was not working for me. I am used to a more close nit environment and Carrington simple was not. Too corporate  and stuffy. The offices where horrific I could not bring my clients there did not even have land land phones. As a real estate/mortgage Broker I expected much more. "

"Manager,RtlLnd,Prtfl","Business Model was not what I had expected when I was hired. I expected to entertain outside business along with our internal portfolio but there was so much incompetence among operations and sales as so many do not belong in this industry. My strengths were not being utilized to increase my business as well as the company, plus Carrington could never close a file on time. Playing with people's livelihood is not a good thing ever. This is why there is such a huge turnover with employees, they work their tails off and in the end, compensation was completely faulty. Benefits were excellent though. My current position at my new employer, I am earning 4-5 times more than what I was earning with Carrington and not having to work 50-60 hours weekly and not having to drive 70 miles daily."
RE Sales Agent,I never really started - never met the office manager which I found odd. Interview was done by phone & email. Considered the change back to sales at a time when I thought REO was the way to go to generate quick listings (office supplied). After online training for your vendors and looking through all the corporate pages of various contracts I found the work on REO's to be excessive to the final paycheck after everything was taken out. It no longer made sense for me.
RE Sales Agent,It is not possible to do good business without good leads and neither Carrington nor I could provide good leads.
RE Sales Agent,Because I was having a few financial issues and could not pay my association dues on time and I received a letter i the mail from the BRE telling me that I no longer worked there as per your request. It was not exactly my choice.
"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl","I was unable to make money due to the leads being very low. The loans I was being asked to sell were of no benefit to the customer.

RE Sales Agent,"Hello from Arvada!  I was initially very excited about the opportunity to put my many years of experience to work for Carrington, but I soon felt that I was working for a xompeting broker who was taking leads that were xoming into the office and distributing them to his family members (who worked out of the same office under a different company name and/ or taking them for himself."
"Loan Officer,Centralized","I felt my manager was not doing a good job. He held way too many meetings, and treated his employees like children. I also felt the sales lead system was corrupt. Nikki Yun and Tom Choles should not get to cherry pick all of the company's best leads. There was also some sort of problem distributing the inbound calls. Carrington also was not doing a good job on adjusting to changing market conditions, and as such was at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, I hated Catalyst, and Encompass performed so slowly it seriously hindered me from performing my job in an efficient manner"
RE Sales Agent,I want to pursue other avenues besides real estate.

"Loan Officer,Rtl,Prtfl","In January, after 2 years +, upper management decided to split the team I was on and put me in the Centralized call center.  I struggled with higher rates and lower loan amounts and my pipeline went away.  I should have been kept on the full doc team.  Even though we were told ""we will make you whole"" for a drop in commission I received nothing.  I struggled with a management change and the constant negative leadership from our Director/VP.  I enjoyed working for John Parsons and have a great deal of respect for him.  Prior to the change to centralized John understood I was not being utilized properly.  I presented Ryan a proposal in October on a position I believe was and is needed in Westfield.  With the flow of new MLO's and ops staff this office needs a producing training manager.  Someone that works with new MLO's to make sure they are successful.  The current sink or swim method is costing Carrington money.  I miss the team and wish them nothing but the best.

They were always very supportive of my education and worked with me to ensure that I completed my schooling in a timely manner.  It was because of the great experience that I had with Customer Service that I chose to pursue a career with Carrington in the legal department.  Twice I tried to apply for a Litigation Paralegal position that was opened up in Indianapolis, and both times I was turned down without getting to interview.  It upset me that I was not even given a chance to interview with anyone in Litigation, but it upset me even more that I was not even given so much as an email advising me that I was no longer in consideration for the position. I had to email the recruiter (Sarah I believe her name is) multiple times before I even got a response and it was only then that I was advised that they were not going to interview.  This lack of professionalism and this cold way of disregarding applicants disturbed me greatly.  So, I chose to accept a Paralegal position with a wonderful firm.  I loved my time at Carrington and would have happily stayed longer if I had been given the opportunity to work in my career field there, but unfortunately, that was not the situation. I hope in the future, Carrington does not make the same mistake again and pass on a talented individual before interviewing them.  "

"Manager, Branch","I was brought to CMS to grow the Colorado market as an area manager.  I was micro managed by by my SVP and RVP.  They said I needed to become the best processor and babysit the pipeline everyday.  When I brought up my concerns my SVP said, ""maybe I should just fire you or replace you"".  The whole idea was to get additional support.  How operations at the processing level was really bad and why some of my LO's where going to leave.  I got tired of the daily calls telling me I was not good at what I did.  CMS was a good company but I don't know if it came from top to bottom but I know the belive of CMS was to manage two down and that did come from the top.  They have lost great talent and CMS SVP was very arrogant and did not care."
RE Sales Agent,I am somewhat technically challenged.  My on boarding process left me in the dark. 
RE Sales Agent,I left because I wasn't having success with Carrington. I had zero leads after 8 months. 
RE Sales Agent,Better job with pension
RE Sales Agent,"the main reason ws the commission split, also at the begging I was offered REO listings and they were declining more and more and other agent in the office were getting more and more and then on top of that the listing I was getting was only paying 1% commission at the end and after all the work I was putting on this property I was ending getting $200 not really worth for all the work. "
RE Sales Agent,Broker did not do what she said she would do.
RE Sales Agent,"1. completely un organized / 2. Owner (Larry) played favorites and reassigned 2 of my  huge assets to his wife ( Arianna) and one smaller asset to her assistant. This was after I had completed ALL THE LEG WORK ON THESE ASSETS over the course of SEVERAL MONTHS and no warning was given. I had over 12,000 in commissions wiped away, with no warning or explanation. The Broker at the time Jeff Bates, stated he would find out what happened, never heard back from him / 3. Jeff's cousin ( Noah Bates) was always assigned assets as well as well as all the other members of the team that Jeff favored or who had been working with him from the beginning / 4. Company never took responsibility for paying vendors. I have a handyman harassing me TO THIS DAY ( 2 years after the fact) about a re key payment he NEVER RECEIVED even though, the procedure, if it can be called that, was followed to a tee, in order to get him payment. / 5. Payments were ALWAYS LATE, even after deals had closed there would always be an excuse from Jeff as to why monies were not available. / 6. Once Arianna married Larry, her asset assignment BOOMED. She always had the best and most expensive assets assigned to her. The system was not random as they claimed. While Larry and Arianna were taking trips to Europe and having more kids, many of the agents in the company were living hand to mouth and eeking out deals, even though the Boomtown system created was supposed to be this great lead generator, what a joke. Everyone knew Carrington was great at the ""trickle down"" asset economics and there was definitely a pecking order. / 7. I once saw on Jeffs MLS he saved a search as a ""house for DA NIGGA Bruce"" ( disgusting), as I am African American and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that. /  /  / One of the most unprofessiona"
RE Sales Agent,Because broker wasn't truthful. Carrington compliance took 3 or 4 weeks to clear my commission checks. Equator would asks for tasks over and over. When had been completed more once. Dropping my local mls which i needed badly. Very more communication.
"RE Sales Agent, Team Lead",I moved and am still unsettled as to my final destination
RE Sales Agent,"Im sure they are a great company for experienced realtors. But as a new realtor in the business, i was looking for hands on training, one on ones and a mentor who is willing and patient enough to train. I was also looking for a broker who offers leads. Carrington only provided leads to realtors with experience and high closing rates."
RE Sales Agent,Inaccurate pay stubs and excessive transaction fees are the number one reason. I am now at a company where I pay no transaction fees I get 100% commission and I only pay $79 a month.  I would have stayed at Carrington had I been treated better but I was not treated well and they were taking 60% of my pay so it was an easy decision to move after the Foreclosure pipeline stopped.  /  / I also had a major problem with a contractor of yours Nationstar... and when I tried to force compliance on them the broker threatened to fire me. /  / It was best that we part ways on all levels. I did not feel the company was loyal to me in any form nor did they support me and it was sad because I made them a lot of money over time
RE Sales Agent,"To many benefits in Carringtons behalf. Commission split to high, players club received payment out of my commission. I have no idea what the players club represented in relation to Carrington.  Usually didn't receive commission on a timely manner. From what I experienced I would have to know all of the real estate answers in order to revolve any issues regarding Real Estate. Contracts Sat on the desk of admin which held up my commission check. "
RE Sales Agent,I didn't leave I received a letter from the DRE..saying I was no longer a part of Carrington 
"Loan Counselor,Srvng,I","Carrington has the potential to be a wonderful company! Currently it doesn't seem as the customers are that important. When I left there were steps being made to change that. At a very slow progression rate though. 99% of the calls I took were of unhappy customers. Of course not all the blame was Carrington on these calls, but majority were. Carrington is striving for an improved atmosphere for its associates. It does not seem every manager/supervisor in the Plano location lives to that standard 100%. Seems like a very high school environment. Favoritism shown to certain associates. Exceptions being made sometimes for certain associates/supervisors. Communication was also not the best between managers to supervisors. Then supervisors to associates. A lack of proper communication can & will create frustration & a lack of trust.  /  / I have not been with Carrington for a few months now. I'm not sure if the things I witnessed are still valid. /  / I hope this helps Carrington be the awesome company is meant to be "
"Specialist,LnStUp,Whls,II",Too much overtime 
RE Sales Agent,"I never got paid commission on time too much money was taken out of commission check. Money from my check was going to non existent organization called "" players club"". Did not trust my manager who knew nothing about real estate and gave all the wrong answers when I had a question and became extremely defensive when I questioned what ""Players club"" was? When you call corporate office no one could answer questions or in most cases no one would answer phone to assist you with questions. Never received promised leads."
"AVP,Broker/Manager",I will pass on this. 
RE Sales Agent,"When I had a commission issue, the corporate people in charge of my commission had no interest in helping me.   "
"Manager, Branch, Ramp-Up Producing",I received an offer to manage without be concerned with recruiting or originating 
RE Sales Agent,I wanted to do rentals in Boston as I learned the sales side of real estate. Several changes in office managers in a brief time period as well as the consolidation of offices to a location outside of Boston eliminated the rental aspect of the position.
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I",I left Carrington due to no fault of Carrington. I felt at home with Carringotn and really loved my career their. I started having issues with my hand and wrist and when I went to the ER I found out I had Gangelion Cysts and had to get them removed. The only thing I would have changed about my career was the department I was in. I did enjoy my employment with Carrington and hope one day when my hand and wrist is healed I could possibly come back.
"Accountant, Sr.","The manager I met during the interview was not the same person I worked with. Everything we discussed during the interview did not occur once I started. She was a rude, unprofessional and unethical manager that assigned me to tasks that were not part of the job I assumed I was taking when I joined CMH.   she allowed offsite managers and employees to harass me in emails where I was humiliated with multiple people CC'd and had no direct connection to my tasks. She placed an equal employee as my direct supervisor because in her own words ""she didn't have time to deal with me""  The environment around me was one of hostility since everybody around me gossiped in the early hours (before 8) about fellow employees, someone new like me and managers. when I gave notice and had an interview with HR, the same gossipers blamed me for taking away the manager. That I must've done something to her.   Given the work assigned to me there was no opportunity for advancement or growth, as agreed in the interview. I was completely candid during the interview and that was obviously not reciprocated. I was lied to.  A manager with numerous years of experience would not be behave that way towards anybody, let alone a new employee.   "
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",I  discovered  I had some medical problems after I started he job ! And I  am taking care of my health now.     Phil is an awesome guy to work for !  Very patience and knowledgeable !    And Carrington is a great company.   I will recemend to all !    At this time I don't want a lot stress   So I am taking care of my health   If I can be of any help. Please let me know .    Thank you for your concern    Regards   Sherry Meyer  
"Specialist, Post Close, MLD",Poor management 
RE Sales Agent,Found a broker that I like and trust closer to my home address- commute is much better-easier.
"Coordinator, Default Invoice",My manager at the set me up to fall.  Poor poor training 
"Developer, Application Integration, Sr.",Lack of 401k. No pay increase in over 3 years with annual review ratings consistently 'exceeds expectations'. Too much emphasis on timeline for projects sometimes at the cost of quality.    I really enjoyed working at Carrington. Both the work I was doing and the team I was working with were great. Unfortunately with no retirement plan and no pay increases I had to move on to meet my financial goals.
"Specialist, Customer Service, I",Thank you for sending this survey. I enjoyed my time at cCarrington but feel as though my skills were not being fully utilized. The department in which I started was not fulfilling for what I can offer Carrington. I look forward to reapplying in a couple of minutes maths. Thank u
"Underwriter, Retail Branch, Team Lead","Carrington could be a great place to work under the right managment team. Many of the staff in place or hired is because they are either related to someone or knows someone. The experience level doesn't seem to matter. There are candidates put in place that don't want to be in the role that was chosen for them . Helen Medina is a prime example of telling everyone she didn't want the UW management role but was forced to take it . She hates Carrington if it wasn't for the money she wouldn't be there. Is that something you really tell your staff as a manager . Or you have team leads that encourage there staff to lie is that managment material .The environment is very cady almost like high school with no respect for other employees. People are very jealous and if you are not of color you don't have a chance . If you look at the people in managment positions under Jawana , La Vita Closing manager but stepped down, Daisey McClellan who was promised the UW manager position and if it wasn't for Rodney Young she would of got the position although no experience for that role. I have never worked in such an unprofessioanl enviroment . It started to affect me and my ability to deliver the exceptional service I am use to giving "
RE Sales Agent,The promises that are made are seldom followed through on. The agent is nickle and dimed to death over every deal. It was not uncommon to have deal the closed where the payoff was 2500 but after fees and splits I came away with 810.00. Having to be at the beck and call of numerous tasks. Then add all the required visits  and when all is said and done I really made maybe 400. Programs would be constantly announced that were to benefit the agent but never implemented. We lost a lost of agent who would do the first deal and leave after seeing their net after all the hard work they put in. We were getting charged a sign fee for signs that were often never provided. Rekeys were often disallowed over a picture not being clear or submission not on time when it would have been easier for there to be a corporate acct to handle this. Field services were a joke half the time doing such a piss poor job I had to clean up to make it look decent. All in all the benefits that were offered were completely outweighed by the constant barrage of fees and other incidental that just always seemed to pop up. Upper management was clueless as to have to grow our office. We hired people and had them under contract for months and then the company decided to change the terms of their agreement to a considerably  less favorable one and expected the office manager to retain people that we were screwing over. No willingness to adapt for our unique market. Our profitability made us the cash cow and yet deal that were already being used in other state we are in that would have greatly increased our numbers were shot down and discarded. This is what happens when you hire and promote people that don't have real real estate experience and allow them to lord over those that are in the trenches giving their lifes blood trying to grow a career. I was appalled at some of the incidents involving the pay of agents. I myself had a transaction that closed and even though it was a cash deal and everything was in and approved took nearly two months to pay out. People have family and bills to pay and cant afford such delays for the very money they earned. It stops from the top down and until that is rectified  I see no future for these real estate  arm to succeed.  
RE Sales Agent,I was over promised and under-delivered form what my broker I would receive here . I'll never again work for a broker owner-they are all the same 
"Specialist, Closing, CTS",I was hired as a closing specialist but I basically just became a receptionist. I felt like I was a bother to the team I was hired by. No one ever had time to train me on anything and I felt very uncomfortable asking for help. I would try and transfer phone calls to closers on my team and they seemed bothered by the call. I even had to announce that I was going to the restroom or leaving my desk for any reason. 
"Loan Processor, Centralized, Sr.",Left Carrington to take a job closer to my residence. Even though it was a tough decision I need to be closer to home and the drive was just to far.
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","compensation.  When I announced I was leaving, Chad informed of the new comp plan, but at that time, I had already made commitments.   Current rate looks very good !"
"Analyst, Loss","The way management talk down to you,  over hearing other employees trained to talk down to customers. no 401K no annual increases mostly management and the way they treat you and the way they talk to you and for and furthermore no diversity pay is very low"
"Account Manager, Sr.","As I told HR in Plano, TX - I came into work every morning asking my supervisor Stephanie Flores what I can do to help the branch. She kept telling me they were to busy to train me. So,I tried training myself (watching tutorials) to keep me busy. The manager John came up to me 5 days later and asked how training was going, and I said I wasn't being trained, just ignored as a new employee struggling to come in to work to sit and do nothing for 8 hours. He said he was brining in a new manager on Monday and the manager would train me on the computer system.  The new manager started, and I sat there again for another 3 days being ignored.  I couldn't stay any longer.  If this is the management that Carrington hires and this is the way they treat new employees, I do not want to be a part of it.  It is sad that I have a lot of experience and to let people just sit and do nothing and not even say ""good morning"" ?   No respect for new employees. "
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I","The call center  structure setup doesn't work effectively and efficient in that environment, ie. Modification Bankruptcy foreclosure department, Most call center have polite line where you can transfer call to different department without being on a call all day, trying to transfer right person. You should have research department or phone to transfer a call, Team morale is bad very poor leadership"
"Specialist, Special Servicing", I thought the training could've been a lot better and also I think the bonus structure was so unfair ..  instead of keeping somebody's bonus I think they should've just been penalize for the QA control numbers .. 
RE Sales Agent,No broker support as to receiving assets.  The office worked on a very closed circle of agents that the broker knew before Larry left the office.
"Specialist, Customer Service, I",I left carrington because I was going through personal issues with my daughter being sick. I didn't know I could do fmla until I was about to leave 
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","MY boss didn't know what he was doing, couldn't close loans on time environment sucked to work for, no training "
"Specialist, Post Close, MLD","It wasn't a good fit for me, the people are very unfriendly, rude and unprofessional the Manager was very unprofessional he made differences with the employees which he had favoritism He didn't know anything about how to train or talk to the employees he made me feel like I was about 60 years old.  He had no compassion and no knowledge about being a manager,  he's friends with ONLY SOME of the employees.  The Training was terrible I would NOT recommend this company to my worst enemy.  Oh yea when I was leaving he tried not to pay me for my PTO Ughhhhhh! worst company to work for and he never said good bye to me"
RE Sales Agent,Commission program is not good and in addition to the commission split you have additional fees attached to it.     There are no agents in the office. 
RE Sales Agent,I was a new agent and I just needed guidance on what to do. 
"Underwriter, Retail Centralized, II","1) Almost 5 years with the same hope of a 401k - Industry crash - My Husband and I liquidated my 401k.  Needed to rebuild retirement investments.      2)  Hourly wage way below industry standards offset was high bonus structure.  Bonus incentive re-adjusted, volume declined, product risk increased QC defects effected bonus .  I could not pay my mortgage payment alone with total monthly bring home pay. Mtg payment @ $3,900.00 - My Monthly Net Pay Approx $3,700.00 - (without bonus) With bonus pay $4,500. -$5,000.      3) Company direction to choose Not to allow the idea of remote Underwriting - Restriction seemed silly when we Carrington is an automated Company.  Saving the company overhead and office space expenses, while increasing my monthly income with out increasing my pay.  Commute expense and time saved able to increase volume of loans and bigger bonus.    4)  Over the past two - three years the hired and promotion of excessive and redundant layers of unnecessary middle management staff lacking industry knowledge and experience was ridiculous.  How many people does it take to run reports for each division? Seriously.  The invested Software technology is there and has the reporting   capability. Use it.  Instead of hiring / promoting over paid individuals act as report retrievers.  The misuse careless waste of company funds was erroneous.  I started with Carrington when our monthly total Company Wide Funded volume was $45 million Retail and Wholesale divisions combined. I took pride in working there and wished that it sometimes would have stayed a mid size well profitable company without so much risk and people to really worked to earn they paycheck and well desired.           I have probably said too much,  however you stated to be candid.  So I hope you use this information.  Please pass on to Bruce Rose, Dave Gordon, and Scott Reed that it was a pleasure and honor to work with them.  I was their biggest fan. If some house cleaning and trimming of unnecessary phat is done.  I would be really interested in joining the Carrington Family again. It was and will be a great company to work for again.  But someone needs to evaluate why, and what all the management ? and Director's are really needed for.  Restructure staffing to yield a large profit.  Clean house.     Respectfully,  Nicole Martinez     "
"Coordinator, Field Services, II",Low compensation with high level of work. Work and computed compensation doesn't add up. Unnecessary job processes were added to our daily tasks where it shouldn't have been. 
"Loan Officer, Centralized","Was basically reprimanded for doing purchase loan and told, you know we aren't good at that.  I have been in the business for years and if the only thing you can do is streamlines you will not survive in this market.  Also did not appreciate the way Dennis Heuman treated people and is was up my direct chain of command.  I did not like the expectation of nights and Saturdays either.  Though I do sometimes work those on my own, did not want it dictated as I do have other out of work responsibilities.  Overall I just wasn't confident in my long term happiness and/or earning potential within the company. "
"Specialist, Loss Analysis","I was offered a position in an industry that isn't dependent on interest rates or the stock market.  This position came with better hours and a retirement package.    Even though I was only employed with Carrington for three days, I could tell that director ran his department different than other departments.  Lunch breaks could begin at 11:30, but everyone had to be back by 1:30.  He requested that everyone take their breaks at the same time.  He also stated that there was to be no food at the desks; however, the department next to ours was happily having snacks while working.  I'm all for rules and I realize each department may need to have some additional rules, BUT the rules I mentioned above need to be company wide.  "
"Manager, Branch, Ramp-Up Producing",Hi There I was told we had a jumbo program for my customer profile. When I came on board I found out you didn't. So I decided it wasn't a good fit for me. Great subprime conventional lender. Clinton and Harold were also very very nice to work with it just wasn't a good fit for me.
"Underwriter, Retail Branch, Sr.","The company lacks ethics, I was under constant pressure to approve loans that I never would have at other lenders.  When a market manager felt comfortable enough to tell me in email that he wouldn't give me a donors bank statement as required by HUD because he knew it wouldn't meet the requirement, it spoke volumes about the corporate culture and I knew that long term association with such a company would hurt my reputation in the industry, as well as conflicting with my ethics"
RE Sales Agent,"was promised leads, then told had to do a 4 week video training, unable to obtain videos, took weeks to get. was told carrington had over 100 bank owned properties that i would have access to so i could do open houses, looked and saw only 5. felt as though Adrian had been dishonest with me and reneged on what he promised at interview.  The numbers he told me agents were doing did not line up with what I saw. I understand wanting me to do training if that is required, but I sold 30 homes last year and at the interview Adrian told me that he would not make me do the training to get the leads. I can not work with a company that I can not trust because how will i make my clients believe in Carrington if I don't."
"Specialist, Customer Service, I","I didn't like the direction the company was going. They made supervisors unapproachable and it was almost a crime to get up from your desk to seek help if you wouldn't call the help line and wait on hold first. The supervisors were lazy and irritable even though most of their work load was put on the escalation reps. Nobody really cared about the customers. They based incentives off of the number of payments you took even though we didn't SELL any services or products all while telling us to promote customer self servicing. It's like working against yourself. It was almost impossible to get the larger bonus because bilingual reps could take Spanish and English calls while we could only service English. They were GARANTEED Spanish payments which was an unfair advantage over everyone else. My bonuses went from $700 to $50 a month once the incentive plan changed. The company seems like they care more about PAYMENTS than anything. The point system made NO SENSE at all. If I was over 15minutes late I would accure 1 full point. But if I decided not to come to work at all for 3 days straight it was still 1 point accrued total! Even if you had the PTO to use, it had to be pre scheduled, so no emergencies and important matters were accepted and still counted against you. If a person decided they wanted to take a vacation and sleep at home for a week and you had a very important court date or surgery for that same day, it didn't matter, and wasnt approved because there was already 6 people out of over 200 employees off that particular day so you were out of luck! And pointed! They made it so that you didn't want to come to work! I was genuinely unhappy working there! No morality just MONEY PAYMENTS AND REFINANCING. "
"Coordinator, Field Services, Assistant","My honest opinion I did not wanted to leave Carrington. I'm currently senior at CSUF and this semester was a tough one for me. My school schedule interfere with work. Even though , Carrington was super flexible with my schedule I had to much in my plate. I was involve in a sales leadership program and started an internship. I would definitely go back if could and would recommend this company to my colleagues. "
"Underwriter, Wholesale, Sr.","Carrington is a great place to work and I really liked working for CMS. Great manager and team. Unexpected illness with my husband and was not there a year to take FMLA and needed time off to be with husband. After time off, accepted a remote position full time to be at home with husband. "
"Analyst, Collateral",I reached out to HR several times when I was at CMS and it was a waste of time.  I'm not going to waste any more time explaining why CMS was a wholly miserable experience.
"Specialist, Order Entry,CTS",Management team made promises that were never acted upon. I was promised a raise over a year and half and it never came. 
"Coordinator, Field Services, Assistant",Just not a good environment.
"Account Manager, II","The reason as to why I left Carrington is because of nepotism, favoritism (clique), unfair treatment, an unhealthy work environment (mentally & emotionally) which was very stressful and caused made my hair fall out, made to in to someone I no longer recognized.    I worked in the Loan Set-Up Department and inquired about the Account Manager position approximately a year and a half ago and was told that I didn't have enough experience per Andre Harriott and Steven Santa.  Last year one of the Sr. Account Executives asked me if I was interested in becoming an Account Manager which I accepted and regretted soon after.  Training wasn't adequately provided, 3 days were given and then I was thrown in to it without a paddle to save my life.  When I would ask for assistance, my manager would suck his teeth, roll his eyes and give me attitude for asking.  He would talk down to me and be very condescending and rude on the floor in front of all of my co-workers which was extremely embarrassing.    I stopped asking for assistance and tried to figure out things on my own.  Family members and friends of other co-workers were hired as Account Managers and started making more money than me (they were provided with more help and given less complicated accounts and closed a lot of streamlines).  Please keep in mind that they did not have any mortgage experience.  Some worked at car dealerships and one worked as a makeup artist.      I have more than 10 years of experience in the mortgage industry and considered it a slap in the face.  I wanted to become a better Account Manager so that we could meet our monthly goal but was not provided with the tools required which was unfortunate.      I would like to add more but I won't because it still hurts to go back to a painful memory.    "
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I","Very poor management, hell some collection supervisors had absolutely no experience and no communication skills. Especially the collection manager and supervisors."
"Auditor, Branch/Internal","I moved back to Denver and was planning to work for Carrington remotely, but my prior employer (where I had worked for 20 years previously) made me an offer to resume my old position that paid a bit more and doubled the vacation that I was getting at Carrington. "
"Analyst, Investor Accounting, Sr.",Recieved an offer to work remotely so I can assit my elderly parents. A salary increase was also a benefit 
"Supervisor, Collateral Document","I had to give my self a chance in a career that I  have my degree in, plus I needed to work where 401K was offered. I took a major pay cut leaving Carrington but I have to atleast give my nrw position 6 months before making a decision to come back. I would love to come back but in my same department and as a supervisor like I was prior."
"Loan Officer, Centralized","Management seems very disorganized.  My manager is very unprofessional and did not have his NMLS license, which was a major concern since he discussed  with customers over the phone."
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",Health reasons
"Loan Officer, Centralized, Senior","Over the last 6 months, there had been several changes that affected the management team that were passed on to their subordinates.  Given that these were going to continue and that it would continue to be a distraction to me, I decided to make the change at this time.  The management team , especially sales manager are more determined by who they know then what they know."
RE Sales Agent,"I felt there was no a family feeling, everyone on their side, although the broker is a nice person,  professional, as a new realtor I did not feel comfortable with the overall process. Nissan an excellent person, very approachable.  Parking a challenge."
"Loan Officer, Centralized","new opportunity, Company matching 401K, higher base"
"Specialist, Post Close, MLD",I wanted to try AML compliance 
RE Sales Agent,I feel that there was a lack of support on the brokers part.  I started there with a lot of enthusiasm and I am very grateful for what I learned about REOs.   I also did not like that when ever I had to scan documents I was unable to access my documents if the transaction coordinator was not there. 
"Specialist, Post Close, MLD","My experience at Carrington was very short and disappointing. My training was cursory and rushed, giving I had little experience in the field. I eventually managed to mastered the job but felt undervalued by my manager. Secondly, my co-workers were very negative. Employees talked negatively about each others and I felt management bought in to that. Overall, I liked the company but felt very appreciative and undervalued.      "
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",Loan process is broken. Applications go in but never come out on time. I've lost relationships with RE Agents because of it I 
"Manager, Customer Service","The drive was very far from my home, I underestimated the distance from when I interviewed in the late morning when traffic was light and during rush hour.  In addition the work environment was very stressful.  The VP was very demanding and rude to team members  (not myself) and I did not share his management style. (Rule by fear of losing obesity job). Last, there were not merit increases which was never discussed in my interview.  Had I known there was never any opportunities to increase my salary I would have never accepted the position. "
"Specialist, Bankruptcy, I",Terrible management and a lot of nepotism in the Bankruptcy Department. The entire  bankruptcy management team is the worst I ever worked for. Eric is not a great leader and the department had no direction. Mangers Rosa and Heath didn't have any experience in Bankruptcy and only got their positions because they worked with Eric at another company. Manger Heath talked to people in the wrong manner and was very disrespectful to people. I actually quit they working there with out having a job lined up because it was so stressful to work up under the management. If this was my company I would get rid of the entire management team in Bankruptcy. Your company will have a hight turnover rate in that department due to management.
"Coordinator, Field Services, II","I felt the work itself was not a good fit for me.  The management and staff were flexible and supportive & encouraging; I felt Julie and Nathan were good leaders. This was a personal decision and I was very sorry that it did not work out as anticipated. The benefits were good, the office was close to my home & the relaxed dress code were all nice to have. I have so much mortgage experience that it may have been the wrong decision to gravitate in another direction.  I am sincere when I say thank you for allowing me the opportunity to work at Carrington."
"Loan Officer, Branch, Inside","No support for loan officers in retail branch, felt like I was on a desert island. No training sink or swim. Unable to speak to Underwriters, Processors to ask for help with files. If you did ask for help on a file to the processor they made you feel like you should know the answer and didn't provide help. It was like they were there to turn down files not approve them.  Every file was a fight, they were held up in processing being pre-underwritten before it even made it to underwriting. I was supposed to be an internal loan officer until one day the phones stopped ringing and no one could provide an answer as to what was happening, and was told to go out in the field to get business with limited loan programs. I didn't feel the company was transparent as to their intentions. Limited availability of loan programs. Unable to do down payment assistance programs, high rates. We were told we were going to be getting lower rates on Conventional loans in February and to the date I left it still had not happened. My branch managers were amazing and were the only support I had, and I really appreciate everything they did for me."
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I",Too far for the pay and hrs and work requested
"Loan Officer, Branch, Outside","Well, where do I begin? It was promised to me that Carrington will pay part of my advertising expenses in the Russian community, so that I can get more business and name recognition. That did not happen. The biggest reason for leaving, though, was that I  did not get any training or support from my management. Closing loans with Carrington and navigating the system felt like driving with the blindfold in the fog. I never knew what the next step is, and it made me look pretty bad and inexperienced with my clients (even though I have been doing loans since 2002).I found that the whole system (100 different passwords, etc..) is way more complicated than at the other companies. Maybe if somebody spent time with me teaching how to work the system, it would have felt less complicated, I am not 100% sure, though.  Another biggie for me:Tons of emails a day from Ray Brussau pushing for numbers, in addition to emails telling me the pipeline numbers, turn times, emails asking me to vet ideas in vetter just felt like company is all about the numbers (not people), plus it took so much time each day to go through them, so I felt like it was more than I can and want to handle. At some point it just became so annoying, that I could not wait to leave, just so I want see another one of those emails. The only two emails that I found useful were Rate sheets, and tip of the week from UW department.  In addition to that, I was offered .5 more per loan at the other company. Even though I was offered salary plus commissions at Carrington after I left, it still felt that I will not be able to succeed to the level that I picture myself at, if I have to continue to sit in the office for hours waiting for the manager to give me 5 minutes of his time.  Before I left, I heard my manger mentioned that he plans to recruit more LOs, and I really hope that he will offer them better support than he offered me. I constantly felt that my loans, my time, my success is not important to him because he was also originating his own loans. Honestly, I can very much relate to that, as MY loans and MY clients are the most important thing to me as well. I am not sure if there are managers out there that can originate their loans and simualteniosly help others grow and succeed, but it was not the case with me.  Hope it helps,  Inna  "
RE Sales Agent,"I found an opportunity with another Real Estate company that offer me an steady income working at the accounting department, while still developing my Real Estate business."
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I",Found a better paying job in the same position.
"Specialist, Foreclosure, I","I left carrington because of the lack of communication with their employees and when there was communication it was to intimidate you and to make you feel like you where going to be fired. Last was pay. I didnt like the feeling that every end of the month it would be my last month and for little pay and no recognition of the hard work I was putting in. I dont need a pat on the back every day, every week but I also think I don't deserve to feel that my job was on the line every day. This is not only my feeling but many others in the department I was in. About 7 people who knew I was leaving wanted to know if the new place I was going to was hiring. I felt bad for them. I believe the reason for the low moral in the depart I was in was due to management. I even saw when management be rude to other managers. Managers talking down to other employees. Very disheartening. I hope this helps. "
"Coordinator, Field Services, Assistant",Manager continued to pile on more work and I would progress and there was no monetary compensation.
"Specialist, Customer Service, I",Supervisor  Carlo Long played favorites and the manangement was unfair to black people
"Coordinator, Field Services, II",They never told me
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I","I left Carrington because I really needed to make at least a $1-1.50 more per hour.  I was taking a pay cut working in Westfield for the amount I was offered.  I was also under the impression that I would be working towards my monthly goal right out of training.  Chris, the manager, said the soonest we could work towards our goal was October which would have made November my first possible chance for receiving a bonus.      I could have tried to negotiate a higher pay, but the commute was no longer conducive to my career path.  I had to fill up my tank twice a week to get to work.  The drive was no longer feasible especially when I felt like I was given false information during the interview process.  While I was there, I found out customer service bonuses were higher than the collections bonuses.  I always wanted to work for the company and I was even willing to relocate.  However, I no longer had the desire to do so if I had to struggle every week to get to work and wait until November for my first chance of a bonus."
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I",Unorganized and inconsistency within department. 
"Loan Processor, Regional Sales Center, I",Unprofessional and unethical environment. Lack of respect for hard working intelligent employees with no development in scope.
"Specialist, Loan Set-Up, RegSalesCtr,II","I loved Carrington at first until the management team started being disrespectful, condescending and untruthful. I was told I would get two promotions and it never happened. I trained the entire office on title and certain processes and asked about a leadership role since I was training managers and not being properly compensated. Overworked and underpaid and no support or defense from management. I would provide my ideas that were implemented without even receiving one ""thank you"" or ""good job"". I was told that my position didn't have a leadership role when indeed I found out it did. I was also told that my position was going nowhere and if I wanted to be in underwriting then Carrington is not the place for me. We would constantly be threatened about losing our jobs if we didn't do what we were told. It was not great. "
"Underwriter, Retail Branch, Sr.",I was offered more money and a sign on bonus to return to my previous company
"Specialist, Order Entry,CTS",I have a teaching degree and I decided to go back to teaching. 
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I",I did not want to Lea e my father was diagnosed with prostrate cancer and I had to leave the state to care for him.
"Loan Officer, Branch, Inside","RSC Director Oliver called all Females in the office ""Bitches"" more than twice.  He's crude and demeaning and lied to the previous Sales Manager and myself. He's sleeping with the lady he promoted to Sales Manger, after giving her a 10,000 signing bonus and the position despite her having no experience. All seasoned Loan Officers quit well before I did.     Carrington HR is fully aware of all of this. They are unaware that the legal case is pending and will be filed before year's end. Workplace Discrimination, Hostile Work Environment, loss of income.   "
"Specialist, Default MI Claims",Lack of strong leadership there was alot of favortism in my department. Massive amounts of overtime with no yearly raises or feedback and no retirement plans available to employees.
"Analyst, QC Servicing Communications",I left Carrington for a better opportunity better pay and room for growth.
"Specialist, Document, I",The reason I left Carrington was because I moved to Perris Ca and my commute to the Anaheim location would take a  2hour drive to get there and another 2hr drive to get back home. I do have children and it was not in the best interest for me to be so far out from my kids in the event of an emergency. I tried to relocate to the murrieta office but they did not have an operations team there. I also asked if I could work from home but that option was never answered. I loved working for Carrington and I was really close to my supervisor (Sandra Guerrero) which I dearly miss. 
"Funder, II","I left for several reasons. I was offered a better position with better benefits, better pay and working from home within the same industry. The company values its employees, gives back to their employees, respects us, there's a balance between work and life, and they encourage a fun work environment, as well.     My manager at Carrington over worked me with no recognition of the work I did. I was expected to put work before my family. I was expected to continuously be a top performer and when I wasn't due to vacation time I was treated poorly and made to feel guilty for taking my time off. I did the work of two closers when my teammates didn't pull the weight of one more often than not.     The environment became toxic. We weren't allowed to communicate with one another. There was office drama that was never dealt with properly, even though it was reported to my manager.     Overall, Carrington was by far one of the worst companies I've worked for and I'd never return or recommend others to work for them. I chose to work for an honest company who cares about their employees and their families."
"Specialist, Default MI Claims",Poor management alot of favortism in the claims dept no room to advance no retirement savings option and no yearly salary increases also an exorbent amount of mandatory overtime.
"Specialist, Lien Release",Not able to post for another position within the co. Did not feel Management backed up their employees. Should have one on one meetings to get feed back up and find out employees goals also found a new opportunity with more pay and convenient hours
"Processor, Loss Mitigation",Career change
"Specialist, Training & Development, I",Received significantly higher offer during my first week with Carrington.
"Manager, Customer Service","I was recruited by First Merchants Bank through my linked in profile and then eventually selected for a role as the Assistant Director, Vice President of Customer Service responsible for the overall operations of the Call Center, Training and Quality.    In my year in a half there it was challenging and full of growth.  I genuinely feel I had the opportunity to make a difference.      When I approached Kirk Duggan to advise of the career opportunity afforded me there was no open discussion as to what could we do to keep you but rather advised that I would be having an exit interview in the next hour and that my belongings would be mailed to me.  I questioned this and was told it was about optics and that I could not be trusted to not recruit the staff.  After contacting Human Resources asking if I was being terminated I then was able to meet with Kirk Duggan and Paul Vitt and advised that I was not being terminated but being sent home to think over my offer.  When a previous manager provided a verbal discussion related to leaving she was not create the same way.    Some of the overarching concerns that led me to hear what First Merchants had to offer were the following:    Leadership ( Managers, Supervisors) were not consistently held to the same standard of working overtime.      Incentive structure for Supervisors was attached to no real performance goals other than the Team Quality Score and Supervisors who were not performing received monthly $1,200 in compensation.    Follow through on performance issues was not completed and lack of consistency.    Reverse discrimination:  Michelle Akers a previous Supervisor had an unprofessional, agresssive outburst at me on the call center floor was witnessed by another manager, supervisors and call center associates and the issue went unaddressed and only resulted in a verbal conversation.  She had a less unprofessional outburst at a male african american peer after a focus group that resulted in termination.       Leadership takes credit for work performed by others:  Identifying a driver in productivity, Aux codes not dedicating from their productivity percentage but the employee not being on the phone taking calls.  Start Award Recognition Program  Coach Gate  Career Pathing -     Lack of transparency, fails to walk the walk and talk the talk.  Communicates a message and expectations to the staff but does not demonstrate what they are asking others to do.    Lack of performance evaluations    Women are treated differently than men, there is also a degree of sexual harassment  that takes place indirectly; comments about women and taunting.    In spite of what I shared there are a lot of talented individuals there that may just need to be trained and redirected but is extremely important for ongoing success and to avoid potentially costly lawsuits.    I am thankful for my experience with Carrington and wish great success for everyone there."
"Accountant, Sr.","Family matters.  I didn't feel that I could give my 100% while I deal with my personal matters.    I enjoyed working with the entire staff of Carrington Title Services lead by the phenomenal leader, Mr. Jim Potter.    I wish I am be eligible for rehire.    "
RE Sales Agent,"I came aboard the Tampa office as a referral from a Carrington agent in CT. He explained how he was given the fuel to succeed by way of bank listings, first on the low end and then higher as his success intensified.The Tampa office didnt give that same fuel unless you had 5 deals on your own first. In his first year as a realtor he made it to number 1 in sales a few months as well as top 5 in the country for the year. His manager reached out to him daily to see if there was anything he could help with. My manager never reached out to me once. The lack of help was the deciding factor in why I left. I had no idea what I was doing or even where to start. I attended weekly meetings to learn about my S.O.I. and worked them like I was told, no results. I called a few times to get some direction but my calls went unanswered. After speaking to several other agents and several interviews, I made a choice to start over. It was a wise choice with immediate results. "
"Specialist, Loan Servicing Setup","I left mostly due to a position that opened up in another field that was more money and a better opportunity for my family. However, I have never in my life worked for a company with as much drama and un organization as Carrington. Fighting in the isles on the floor, people crying at their desks and management does nothing but a slap on the wrist and the problems continue. "
"Accountant, Sr.","Family matters.      Carrington is a great comaony!  I loved my duties and responsivltes while I was there.  Great people in Texas Title.  What a phenomenal leader, Mr. Jim Potter!  Thank you so much for the opportunity!  I wish to work for Carrington again!"
"Specialist, Title Curative, CTS",I received a job offer 10 minutes from home in Riverside.  Prior to I was commuting approximately 3 hours a day.
"Account Executive, Wholesale",I own a real estate company and found that I was NOT able to put it in my husbands name and did not want to give up my company. 
"Specialist, Title Curative, CTS",I was a commuter and was offered a job close to home.  
"Technician, Desktop, Sr.",I relocated to another city.
"Supervisor, Call Center, CMH","Pretty sure I've done this already but sure, I'll do it again. I left because Chris Gordon wanted to fire me, and I didn't feel like being fired by some unqualified fed from a silver spoon all his life kid because he didn't like me. So I resigned :) "
"Specialist, Customer Service, I","Carrington seemed like a great company to work for at the beginning . I guess I left due to there was things promised that were never fulfilled,ecxpectations that were not met. I know Carrington did not mention I would be a debt collector I was thrown into that situation. CMS redid the bonus structure, the managers and supervisors did certain things for certain people but not for all lets just say they pick and choose. "
"Specialist, Customer Service, I",I left CMS because they didn't follow through with everything I was advs  once I applied..  I was there almost a year and kept applying for shift bids and it was always something on why I didn't get it. They don't care about their employees.. Everybody was just a number to them.. The schedule are terrible. I didn't like the scheduling. or the attendance policy.  they don't work with you if something comes up 
"Supervisor, Call Center, CMH","The overzealous son of  the COO wanted to write me up and fire me for no justifiable reason at all. I did my job and did it real well for 4+ years and the privileged man child came in to our department and decided he didn't like me and wanted to get rid of me. I've never been written up or fired in my life and wasn't going to let that happen now, so i graciously left the job that i busted my ass at for 4 years. :) "
"Loan Officer, Centralized","The ""auto-fails"" are wrong!   To penalize salespeople for making a human error is just not right.  Yet, the processors get to use the unrecorded line #2 and not have to worry about what they talk about with the very same borrower.  You never want to penalize a salesperson as they feed off of rewards, which is how auto fails used to work.  I am looking forward to the class action lawsuit.    Dennis, the Sales Manager, is not even licensed himself due to mortgage violations at previous employers.  He was ok with the massive pay cut.  And, he was involved in sexual misconduct at CMS and had to be spoken to by HR.  Why would I ever want to work under someone like him?  He single handedly ruined the once good sales floor.  I've seen this type of manager bring down large companies all by themselves."
"Loan Officer, Branch, Outside",I got offered a killer job by a bank who works with a builder.  Nothing personal.  I love Carrington.  Dave Gonzales was a great manager.  Harold Michaud was a great bosses boss.   It broke my heart to quit but I got a chance to get a plum job and I had to take it.
"Coordinator, Transaction, I","Zero raises, zero reviews."
"Loan Processor, Regional Sales Ctr, Sr.",The negative atmosphere that came from the top management at corporate and the processor comp plan kept getting cut 
"Loan Processor, Regional Sales Center, I",The inexperience loan officers hired (trainees) could bring the deal in but not screened upfront enough to hold the deal. As a processor your lose so much money with the fall outs.
"Coordinator, Transaction, I","I loved Carrington as a company, great benefits and opportunity, it's what it turned into when the wrong people have power .  I  was forced to work under Brenda Navarro and saw what she was capable of and  aloud to get away with. I witnessed  her spread erroneous rumors and lies about people  just because she didn't like them ..I know for a fact when she got Susanne Baxter fired she also got rid of 5 GOOD people and in the past 5 years she has had 10+ under her belt and got away with it! Sad part is her boss Virginia Pierce new exactly what she did, ask any of the ones who left or got fired( Brenda A. Gene,Adriana, Michael, German, Cynthia, etc.). Luckily I got out and worked  back with CRES . Unfortunately she had told my new boss Brent Houston, now Pat Plourde erroneous things about my work performance and all my accomplishments and my good name was slandered by one person.  She knew my son had leukemia and and bullied me I couldn't leave CPS faster. Then once I saw what went on In CRES  and what management  was doing to the Agents once we moved to Irvine, was truly sad.  I appreciate Carrington and everything I learned . Mean, heartless people can't create a reputable business or can they and that's why they're still there!?!? "
"Loan Processor, Regional Sales Ctr, Sr.",Cuts to processor compensation and negativity from upper management. Lack of training is also a problem 
RE Sales Agent,"I liked the model of Carrington, however was very disappointed by the less than forthcoming information that was provided to me by the Mortgage side of the business. I was told that Carrington could approve anyone with a 500 score, I even advertised this. When it was time to deliver they could not. In more than three instances other brokers were able to close the loans.   I also was disappointed at my commission from my first deal.   "
RE Sales Agent,"I am a licensed realtor since 2004, with a few years hiatus.  I was offered 50% commission cut because I was considered a new agent with no experience.  I felt that what I needed was feedback and guidance from the broker for the first transaction or so, since things have changed considerably in the real estate market. Although my broker was supportive, he is a very busy person and did not have time to update me in the process.  Nevertheless, I am grateful for the time given.      On the other hand, I think that Carrington is potentially good for new agents, as you do not charge upfront fees in order to help agents get established.  Is for this reason that I would recommend Carrington.  . "
RE Sales Agent,"I didn't leave Carrington, I changed positions. I went from a Real Estate Agent yo an Account Manager position. "
"Loan Processor, RegionalSalesCenter, II",Management 
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I","I loved the company but the Management is horrible in SPOC/Collections and very discouraging (Cale,Bob and Fran)"
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I","I left because there was so many changes from when I first started. I use to love my job until they started changing hours & combined the spoc & collections dept. I did not apply for collections but yet we was thrown into the role. I was denied being transferred to a different dept, cashering. I would have made an excellent candidate for the position & it would have given me a more stable position & hours. The majority of the supervisors are very unprofessional & the dept was unorgainized & i no longer had the desire to be apart of a company that played favoritism & refused to allow someone to make a difference in a different dept."
"Loan Processor, Regional Sales Center, I",I was 7 months pregnant when I was hired and when I took maternity leave I had 4 months to be him w baby.    I wasn't ready to leave my son just yet but I had no medical reason so HR said it would be voluntary dismissal.  I liked Carrington very much!  Also I wasn't sure how I could afford daycare.  Patrick Jura was my Supervisor and was fantastic!
"Loan Processor, RegionalSalesCenter, II",Management 
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","Pay too low.  Poor management on RSC side.  Very unprofessional and chauvinistic.  Pay scale and commissions plan changed 3 times in 5 months to the detriment of the sales team.  Expected to work weekends INCLUDING Sunday's.  None of which was discussed in interview.  I have a BS in Business Mgmt., and was VERY disappointed by the attitude and unprofessionalism of this company.  "
RE Sales Agent,"I felt there was zero support. A lot of empty promises made by a much to busy manager who never made good on them. You were on your own. I don't need a lot of help at this stage but where I moved to has someone to help with you marketing, another person to teach the necessary computer programs, etc. Carrington didn't know your name.    I also didn't like when my checks were withheld until there was a complete file when I had done everything and the fault was with the TC."
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I",I was told that I would be a SPOC rep and I was and I loved it until we merged with collections. i started in December and by April I've had 4 supervisors and 4 schedule changes. We were promised things but those promises never came through.Cale was very discouraging to work for. 
"Trainee, Loan Officer, II","The sales director (Shaun) at the Windsor center is extremely unprofessional and lazy. The way he speaks to and treats his employee charges is completely unacceptable in a business environment. He works limited hours a week and does very little in that time to help his team succeed . The center is behind it's peers solely because of his lack of involvement. He has no leadership abilities and in my limited time in that office heard nothing but negative feedback about him from the other employees .  The sales manager (Tim) is a great guy and a extremely hard working individual who has Carrington mortgage best interests always at top of mind. Tim has the respect of every employee in that office unfortunately he is overworked and most times inaffectual because he has no help. I enjoyed working at Carrington mortgage and liked almost everyone I encountered at the company , unfortunately I had no confidence in the leadership of that team and sought a better opportunity elsewhere within the industry."
"Loan Processor, Centralized, Sr.","No training , bad technology . "
"Loan Officer, Centralized",I was pomised the world. Left a company making $18k per month. My manger was non-exsitant. I was there for a week and a half but couldn't even get on the phone. I didn't even get paid the right hours. Your company need better managment and a clear direction. Why do you think your losing people.
"Loan Officer, Branch, Inside","My biggest reason for leaving Carrington was the local reputation of the branch that I had joined. Unfortunately, the referral partners that I work with had had multiple bad experiences with getting things closed in a timely fashion. Some of the Loan Officers working at the local branch were not quality Loan Officers that had a tendency to over promise and under deliver so as I was trying to spread the news I was met with fierce resistance. My immediate supervisor was so busy always putting out fires and holding deals together for the less experienced loan officers that he didn't have adequate time to devote to me as I on-boarded.    Additionally, I spent nearly two months trying to get computer issues resolved so that I would properly and efficiently do my job. The help I received was not satisfactory.    On the other hand I do strongly believe in the product that Carrington is offering and would consider coming back to Carrington in the future if some of the folks at the local branch were no longer working there."
"Analyst, Business Systems, Sr.","I was offered an opportunity to grow in my career at another organization I previously worked for. This decision took over 6 mod for me to act on since I enjoyed working at Carrington PMO team and interacting with multiple lines business. It was a very hard decision to make, but the opportunity offered at the other organization is inline with the direction and my personal career goal I wanted to progress to at this point in my career."
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","Mainly medical and health reason. There were some internal problems (not enough support and training) but mainly it was personal reasons, distance and my health being one."
"Loan Processor, Centralized, Sr.","Management was not what it should be, pushing people for more and more numbers but rarely encouraging.  Instead they would publicly point out how bad your individual numbers were.  I assume that was their way of motivating someone but instead it only makes a person feel horrible.  I really enjoyed this job when I started but as time went on, and it was apparent that my numbers would never be good enough and I lost motivation.  Also, there is much more to life than money but it is obvious that is management's only concern.  "
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","Proximity to home, it was getting difficult to handle the drive with 2 young children.       Would still return in future , loved office , people , environment"
"Underwriter, Wholesale, Sr.","Carrington's main purpose is to ""serve the under served"". I never had an issue with that because I am an excellent DE/SAR underwriter and have been one for over 20 years. Every loan that I reviewed was a Manual underwrite - I was never given a streamline, not once!  BUT what corporate, upper management and immediate management does not realize is that THESE loans are sub prime loans which take time to review, analyze and the need to add over 30 conditions in order to make it a salable loan. The turn time they require is ludicrous..... twenty four to forty eight hours, really?? If you only had one or two loans to work on, then yes, but to be required to underwrite two NEW loans, all resubs AND any file that QC has an issue with, is not humanly possible. I worked there for one year and averaged 12 hour days! I quit without any job lined up just to get my sanity back. I always loved underwriting and helping borrowers, brokers, LO's and processors.... but Carrington is seriously boarder line abusive- the management pushes and pushes for productivity ONLY to reach THEIR BONUS QUOTA.  I worked at Chase, BOA and Citi and, yes, their corporate pushed too, BUT at least they had quality loans NOT sub prime to try to make them work and/or salable. IF management would allow QUALIFIED underwriters, like myself, to underwrite WITHOUT the pressure of productivity turn times then I know for a fact good underwriters, like myself, would still be there. I know several good, qualified underwriters that either left before or while I worked there due to pressure. Carrington needs to realize sub prime loans take time to massage in order to try to make them work AND give qualified underwriters ample time to do their magic. If they want quality loans then management needs to back off and let underwriters do their job!! I finally left due to the stress was affecting my health and my health comes before any unappreciative job!!"
RE Sales Agent,"I left Carrington due to politics in the office. I feel that people in the office are catered to and its not fair to the agents that work hard day in and out. I didn't agree with the split for company because my ""lead"" was making money off me while doing nothing. Broker and TC were great but I'm not going to made to pay a big split with nothing in return."
"Specialist, Loan Set-Up, II",Wages
"Coordinator, Asset, II","No raises, no growth, blatant favoritism, no appreciation for hard workers, ridiculous write ups for dedicated employees and none for employees who were repeatedly and clearly out of line"
"Specialist, Loan Set Up, Centralized, I",I was simply offered a better opportunity for me and my family that I couldn't pass up.  6 figure salary and no relying on commissions after being a commission driven LO for 12+ years.  It's the only reason I left.
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I","I left CMS due to the fact that my husband had received a promotion and job transfer to Jacksonville, FL. In the midst of my return from my maternity/medical leave I found out I no longer had an 8-5 Monday thru Friday shift, but an split two late, two morning, and a mid shift. That shift was unconventional for me and I applied for a transfer position to Jacksonville within two days of my return. I just ended up quiting before I had received an interview in Jacksonville.       I love working at CMS and everything it stands for. "
RE Sales Agent,"False promises that led to financial burden on me and my family.  When I being recruited by Carrington, they promised to co-market with me on Zillow using a Carrington Mortgage lender as well.  I signed the contract with Zillow for $1,000 and Carrington did split the costs as promised for 8 months, but then pulled the plug on co-marketing and left me with the whole bill due to my contractual agreement with Zillow.  I did not receive any notice, just an email saying Carrington was discontinuing my co-marketing.      "
"Loan Officer, Branch, Inside",Carrington did not invest in employees no 401k no profit sharing. The amount of time to get loans clear to close and through qc was too lengthy. Most of closing took 4 to 5 hours and money wire was not there cannot build relationships with referral sources. New manager was hired under false pretenses. I was sexually harassed and HR did not address is a great way. I still have psychological issues due to harassment that I independentantly am getting help for. HR never helped me
"Specialist, Customer Service, I","I feel like once we were out on the floor help was very minimal to none . We were told we were suppose to have someone sitting next to listening to our calls and helping but the managers on the floor had no knowledge of this . We were put on inbound calls without our knowledge and it was very frustrating as we were not prepared to do so . It felt very unorganized and like I was completely on my own once on the phones , I could barely find a supervisor to help . "
"Specialist, Foreclosure, I","The drive into Orange County.  And my manager magda awad.  She openly raised her voice on the floor in front of other people several times.  She acted annoyed that I didn't know everything about foreclosure.  She was very unapproachable, you never knew how she'd react.  She does reviews on the open floor. And she showed no respect to Dennis M.  Also, your human resource called me right after I resigned, I tried to call her back and I left a message asking her to call me again, she never did.  "
"Specialist, Customer Service, I","Everything I was told when I was hired changed within months. I was a customer service representative there for a year. I was hired as an in bound representative and was told we could change positions after 6 months. After the first couple of months they started making us do outbound ""Soft collections"" calls before the end of the borrower's grace period. It went from calling out for an hour or so, to being on out bound dialing for at least 7 hours a day. They also changed our incentive plan and put a freeze on going to different departments. Within the year, the position was totally different. I understand things change, but rules changed on a weekly basis in the reference guide. They expected you to know all the changes all the time, and the supervisors were NEVER on the same page. The company also did not care much about the situations of the borrowers, and all forms of getting information to and from borrowers were through fax and writing. It made it very hard to get things done, both for the borrower and representatives."
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",Unable to live on base pay. Takes too long to be able to make commissions. Worked for 2 months without a single loan submitted to processing. Too much time taking tests for state licenses.
"Manager, Closing Operations, CTS",Career Advancement 
RE Sales Agent,Very little atmosphere. No sense of being part of a team. Company feels generic.
RE Sales Agent,I had no direct connection to the broker of record. She did not know me and I had difficulty getting docs signed that needed her attention. I really enjoyed and respected Wendy forthsyth and Larry white but I never got to worth with them. 
"Coordinator, Repair, II", My manager Katherine Hernandez needs more training.  She has no people skills. I never got a raise in two years or a review .
RE Sales Agent,It was a better fit at another company. 
RE Sales Agent,My commission check took about 2 weeks for me to get paid.  After Many times of communicating and sending over the documents.  2 weeks is too long!
RE Sales Agent,My day time employer provided me an opportunity that wanted to explore.

RE Sales Agent,"Carrington lacks management! When I joined San Jose office, I had high hopes but the office is like a rat hole and the manager stationed in Sacramento doesn't even pick up your phone. No one to guide?!"
RE Sales Agent,"I've been out of business for awhile, ready to start over."
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I",Very bad atmosphere and horrible non supportive management. Management yelling at people on the floor and were extremely disrespectful.  This is was one of the worst places that I have ever worked.
"Loan Officer, Centralized, Senior","Carrington was one of the highest paying companies in the mortgage business when it comes to call center employment.  They paid this by doing away with some of the benefits you can expect to receive at other employers like Bank of America where I worked before coming to Carrington.  Bank of America offered a 401k plan that I could participate in to defer income taxes as well as the company matched a total of 7% of my annual income, so for every $100,000 I made the bank was contributing $7,000 each year to my retirement account . It's not just the match but the ability to defer my income that was important to me.  I was willing to forgo that and join Carrington when they paid us in terms of being a company with top level compensation that made up for a lack of 401k plan.  The work we did at Carrington was more difficult in terms of salesmanship than taking inbound calls at Bank of America in terms of the difficult of selling the deal and warranted being able to make more and the comp plan was aligned to be able to do that.  Shortly after joining Carrington the comp plan changed by what is about 30%, meaning we either make 30% less or have to produce 30% more to get paid the same amount.  With this pay cut and without a 401k Carrington's pay was no longer the only option to make good income.  I think Carrington is still in the top but it should be as it is a sales job that takes a lot of hard work and skill to be good consistently working in outbound environment when many others are more inbound.  I enjoyed my time at Carrington but felt that things were changing with new leadership at the top of sales that was going to have things his way with little input from those of us doing it at the ground level.  I had an opportunity that might not be anymore money, might not necessarily be more but can contribute to 401k and it's still predominantly outbound calls but for clients that have requested to be contacted and thus far the income prospects appear to be equal to Carrington with the current pay structure.  The match on 401k is not as great as Bank of America but it is 50% of the first 6% which is a nice plus as well.  Hope this helps in making Carrington all that it can be.  "
"Specialist, Customer Service, I",No opportunity for growth and self development. Tried many different avenues for self growth & promotion. Even tried to relocate with the compaany. The upper management on sight in Westfield were not there to support us or build team moral. It was extremely negative and favoritism shown across the floor. We were even doing things that made me question morals.
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","Exit Interview Questionnaire         Name:  Deborah T. Vilcheck         Employee ID:  dv005948              Today’s Date:  June 2, 2016         1.Why are you leaving Carrington?  Please be specific.      I was on an extended warning (Shawn Martin email dated May 7, 2016) with specific steps to accomplish in order to remain at Carrington.      I failed to close four out of five loans in May--loans that I had been counting on to justify my commute and time away from family.  I could not continue another month hoping my loans would close in June.     I was on the dialer and received warm transfers but did not call more than a couple of the 490+  prospects in my pipeline.  An obvious failure to keep my end of the agreement.                1.Would you ever refer anyone to work for Carrington?  I would refer anyone who works closer to Windsor, CT to apply.  The positive energy in the Wholesale, Funding, Closing, and Underwriting groups was terrific--hardworking but no complaining.    "
RE Sales Agent,Poor new local office management.  Wrong approach to the employees needs. Poor management support system. Poor relationship between  management and agents. 
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","The very top of the food chain has a do as I say not as I do philosophy. That being said, all personnel at the Scottsdale office, from the top down, were truly outstanding."
"Representative, Call Center, I - CMH",I truly enjoyed working at carrington. I think they company does a lot for their employees happiness. I worked in the call center and that was not where I saw my career being. I did think it may be difficult to move around within the company which is why I left so I could pursue working in lending at a different company.
"Loan Officer, Branch, Outside","Hiring mgr lied about many details.  Promised calls, leads, etc - and knew that call situation had changed when promising.  Actually re-assigned my loan to a new LO in order to cover up conflict of interest - on his part.  This mgr finally resigned but this was several months after reporting this behavior to his mgr.  Operations mgr clearly said he was aware of the issues, yet borrowers were still being misled.    Thought that I could perform after this mgr left, but found that there was NO support whatsoever from higher mgrs.  This resulted in the entire team having to leave Carrington - myself, sales mgr, processor, and set up.    Lastly, there is obvious discrimination issues with these hiring mgrs.  Seems that only men can be considered for most management positions.  For example, when mgr resigned, neither I, nor the current sales mgr (both women) were considered for the position even though both of our experience levels exceed that of the resigning manager OR the new prospects being considered for the position.    I am sure these comments will make no difference as ALL issues were reported to both management as well as complaints to HR with no resolutions or improvements.    FYI - this is the first request that I received for comments since leaving  CMS."
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","In the Jacksonville office, there is a disconnect in process and communication between loan officers, processors and underwriters. This resulted in unecessary delays which lead to poor customer service experience and declines.High loan fallout due to inconsistencies with decisioning files from one loan to another. Consistent RegB violations which creates reputation all risk. Rampant nepotism. People are hired and at the Jacksonville FL branch based on friendships and not competence. Management feed leads to loan officers and processors based on friendships. Rampant partial and disparate treatment. Rampant incompetants within processing and underwriting."
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","Carrington isn't a bad company. Just a lot of kinks needs to be worked out for job responsibilities. Lack of 401k which is an investment for longevity. Better training program, leads and higher bps for in-house loans."
"Specialist, Streamline Modification","I left Carrington because the job was too stressful.  First, I was told that I'd be a processor and it turns out, I was expected to be a processor, Underwriter, and customer service.  It was way too much work for very little pay and very little opportunity to bonus.  The management staff does not care about suggestions from subordinates, even though we're the ones doing the work every day.  I think we'd be more knowledgeable about what's possible and what isn't.  I realized that at Carrington, my or anyone else's who isn't management, doesn't matter at all.  When my one other team member quit, management nearly quadrupled my workload---with now thank you's or words of encouragement.  I'm a human being, not a machine.  On top of all that, I ended up having a panic attack due to the lack of structure, insight, and compassion.  You couldn't pay me to return. "
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","I left Carrington due to poor management and leadership. Although the issues that were affecting production were evident and vocalized, management refused to address them or make any necessary changes to improve production. The environment was extremely unprofessional and hostile, which was brought on by the director and fellow management team members. These issues were brought to the attention of the HR department on several occasions by several employees. All concerns were ignored and changes weren't made.   I believe that the concept of Carrington is a good one. With different, more professional management in place, it could be a fantastic place to work. Until leadership has changed, and the work environment improves, I believe there will be constant turnover and good people will feel forced to leave. "
"Loan Counselor, Servicing, I","I was hired to be single point of contact but then my position changed to collections. If i wanted to be a collector, than that's what I would've applied for. I was also told that after 6 months, I could move to a different position, but there was a hold on that. Hours kept changing w/ none to little opportunity for overtime and CMS seemed to not even care about their employees. The ""it is what it is"" attitude seemed to be a common theme. "
"Specialist, Training & Development, I","I left Carrington because I worked for a VP and Manager who were more interested in their own social status with the company, than actually affecting and creating social change within the organization. The team they created was not a team of trust and unification, but it was a team that felt like a dictatorship. ""Do what I say, or else"" feeling. I was verbally put down several times by my VP, especially when Greg Drakos invited me to a meeting she didn't know about and she yelled at me in the hall and told me to ""Go back to my desk"" and I wasn't allowed to go to the meeting. Instead of calmly having a sit down conversation, post my meeting, like a professional individual, this was common behavior.     Two people on our team were fearful of speaking up because they didn't want to lose their job. I was told by team members to not tell my VP and the Manager anything because it would cause you more headache and it would not change anything, but it would actually make it worse. I experienced that quite often. We wasted a lot of time as a team and when I would bring up efficiency or how to drive the business forward I would be told ""not to worry about it."" My VP would often times barge into a one to one I was having with my Manager and ask her to come and proofread an email for her because she said ""my English is not so good."" I don't mind a team helping each other out, but maintaining personal brand and understanding timing is everything is crucial. Professionalism is everything and there was never any respect for our time or efforts. It was all about her. She also publicly put down my Manager in front of her team and that is unacceptable and unprofessional.     The VP should also, in my opinion, not be in charge of the MA's. I had many discussions about it with Michael Rose and various MA's and they think the way the VP leads their team is ""laughable."" She does not respect their time (shows up late or cancels meetings with them without communicating) and when I was asked to coach a few of the MA's I was told to ""break them"" which I obviously didn't do. I build them up and supported them. I coached EJ and Bri and received nothing but positive feedback. I was approached by other MA's to coach them and I was told no by my VP because ""that wasn't my job."" I told her I had the bandwidth and would love to support them, since there weren't many, but again I was told not to worry about it. The MA's came to me to vent and gain support and not my VP & Manager. I tried to voice this to several people, but again it was brushed under the rug.    I was lied to about my bonus and when I went to HR about it I was told that ""Well I wasn't there and it's discretionary."" Since I am two classes away from graduating with a MS in Industrial & Organizational Psychology, I am very aware of what is ethical and what an appropriate response would have been. That response was not it. I was told when I went to various members of HR about my two leaders actions, that ""I have too high of expectations for leaders"" and that this was life and if I didn't like it I should pursue other job opportunities. There was no mediation by HR, there was nothing done to help me as an individual feel secure and supported to do my job well. Chris Montgomery and Todd Smith were two individuals who were major assets to the team. They upheld integrity, collaboration, professionalism and support leaders should bring to a Training Team. You guys should hold onto Todd.    Outside of how gracious and professional Lori Grigg was at the end with me, (I regret not going to her earlier), I felt the HR team did not uphold their responsibilities in maintaining the ethics, support, mediation and integrity an HR team is bound to by the corporation they service. I gave an inundating amount of feedback to various individuals in HR about my experience, when I was employed with Carrington, and yet no changes or support was given. When I asked if I should go to Lori Grigg, I was told not to because she was ""too high up on the totem pole to disturb."" I was given a ""here is the door"" instead of addressing the problem. I hope this time the feedback will be go toward affecting positive social change. At the end of the day the business needs are what comes first and whoever is in charge of a OD or T team should truly embody those characteristics.     "
"Representative, Payoff",Terri perazzo  Susan weaver  Jennifer fox    That is why I left 
RE Sales Agent,I felt there was a lack of communication. I was with Carrington for over 1 year and was never given the opportunity to manage an REO property although I completed all the necessary training. Whenever i asked my manager for an explanation he could not provide one.  
"Representative, Customer Research, CMS",I received a position with another company for a position Im more passionate about.
"Specialist, Mortgage Insurance",The biggest reason I left was the long commute. I was driving an hour to and from work everyday. I feel more comfortable being closer to where my children are. And with the long commute I was unable to attend a lot of my childrens' activities.
"Loan Processor, Branch, Sr.",The management was terrible. I was very unhappy working there. I was treated poorly. Loan officers were very rude and demeaning and nothing was ever done about it. 
"Loan Processor, Branch, Sr.",The Processing Manager Jaleh Jenkins was allowing the employees to be abusive to the processors. She was also saying atrocious things about the employees behind their backs to other employees not realizing it would get back to us. She had been screaming about my incompetence and saying she was going to fire me while the employee in the office Gennie was hearing everything. I was also written up but given no examples of why I was being written up. It was very vague. I went over the write up with Harold Michaud Jaleh's manager and he wanted specific examples and she had none. Her behavior was completely unprofessional. I knew that I was being written up prior to her providing it me as other employees had informed me that she dispised working with me and that I was stupid. She had voiced her issues about processors and managers not only to me but to other employees. She had told a Manager Dave Gonzales that both myself and the other processor in my office were idiots prior to us working with him. Her complete and utter unprofessional work manner caused both myself and the other processor in our office to feel completely harassed. We were nauseous every day before work and the stress of being afraid of being called and screamed at every day was too much. We were contacted for new employment and even though the pay was not as good we still left as the work environment fostered by the management that we were under at Carrrington was negatively affecting our health. She may be an amazing Processor but Jaleh Jenkins is the worst manager I have ever worked with. She gave no training and simply expects her employees to know how to process with Carrington. I would not in this lifetime or the next ever suggest anyone to work for Carrington Mortgage. I continually did well with Carrington month to month. I not only received my regular commission but received additional commission for quality of loans which is a 20% increase. The office Manager Harold Michaud did not want us to leave because we were always at work we strived to be great and regardless were treated in an unprofessional manner by our manager. I cannot explain how disheartening it is to have another employee tell you all the horrible things that are being said about you behind your back by your manager. If you look into the employee turnover underneath that manager you may realize that just being a great processor does not mean you are meant for management. To be completely honest I have never been so disgusted by a company. Sadly Clinton Alcorn knew of her personality and how she works but felt that the behavior is acceptable. What a disappointment your company was. To work with someone as wonderful as Harold and then to have to deal with such a monster as Jaleh Jenkins was truly one of the worst experiences of my life. Lucky for me I found something else but I feel for the people who are in that environment. I feel for you when an employee gets other employees to contact an attorney and sue for work conditions.
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",Pay structure was changed and the travel distance was too far from my home. Heavy traffic coming and going - grid locks. Very costly to avoid traffic and utilize toll road. Plus the leads were not good. 
"Specialist, Customer Service, I","I asked to be removed from Gerri Jackson team, Teresa Rieger stated I couldn't be removed from the team,but they can conduct a meeting with supervisor and me,to see what is it that she can do to become a better supervisor. I advised Teresa that I did not want to have a meeting with the supervisor. Teresa Rieger and Lillian W.  with human resources discharged me, stating I refused them of doing their job as management. Carrington Mortgage ended the relationship with me."
"Manager, Customer Service",Wrong leadership in positions trying to lead  people. Very unorganized. No communication between departments. No ownership or accountability in one's department. Upper management doesn't have the needs of their employers in mind.Good old boys company and if you don't fit in this model you won't succeed.Need better systems. No road maps for where people are trying to go career wise.
"Loan Officer, Branch, Inside",Unreasonable pressure from upper management
RE Sales Agent,"After working with RE/MAX for over twelve years I was accustomed to a certain environment that Carrington didn't offer. The corporate atmosphere didn't fit my style. It was a disappointment to learn that yes, the office is paperless, but I would have to pay for the service. The main reason I left is that I want to be in a happy place. I did not like working with Kelli Jo and her attitude. That is what made me know I could not work in that office. I enjoyed getting to know the other agents and the classes I attended."
RE Sales Agent,They did not delivered what was promised...did all the training necessary but has been useless
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","I was being targeted by the customer service manager constantly, she had me written up for wearing tennis shoes and never gave me a warning it was a straight written which took away my bonus, then other people who she had written up were excuse from they written but not me, i had to go to the director over her head and have it removed since it was not legitimate and the others were having their's removed due to the fact she didn't follow the company procedures and i was never back paid for my bonus i was told tuff luck, then after she started to pick on me like watching my hold time or wrap time which i was #6 out of 150 agents on the score card i was #10 utilization  was 95% and QC was 100% for 5 months in a row i was winning speedpay contest, refinancing contest and low stats contest and she would accuse me of avoiding calls when i would take in one day 70 to 100 call in a day minimum was 50 and so i started to hate coming to work and decided to just give up and my attendance started to go downhill after that and finally i decided after my written warning it was time to let go and move on so i applied at another call center and was given a new opportunity to be great and do better things cause i applied for other positions at carrington and the manager wouldn't let me be promoted or move to a different department so i quit on may 25th, 2016 i cleaned my desk returned my name badge and walked out. Managment was horrible and my other job before Carrington was Healthcare and i been at my other job for 8 years niw so the day i quit Carrington i pocked up mlre hours until i got the new job at a new call center that offers better benefits and pay and they encouraged me to become a leader for they company! "
RE Sales Agent,I felt the accounting practices were questionable and I could never anticipate my commission based on the numbers. I have a finance degree and I still could never figure it out. I also was hugely dissatisfied with the company reputation and the performance of the ancillary sister companies we had to work with.  I had a cash closing that literally took 3 months to close because of errors from Carrington. It was a cash deal.  That was the last basically all I could take. I was so embarrassed and felt so unprofessional. Not how I want to operate. In addition the 1099's were extremely suspect in my opinion. 
"Specialist, Recording, CTS","My monthly bonus is not what I was told, and then the overtime got reduced significantly. I simply couldn't afford to stay. With that being said, I found Carrington to have a very positive environment with excellent management. (Jennnifer Gressett)"
"Representative, Customer Research, CMS","No raise, overworked, management was horrible. Found a job closer to home with a pay increase."
RE Sales Agent,"Did not provide the leads that were promised. Carrington advertises that quality leads would be provided; yet this was not the case. The leads were old (some 4 years old), obsolete and useless. Having spent 12 years at Zip Realty, I understand that inactive leads are sometimes given to new agents; however, not 100% of all leads. I found out that there were too many agents for a small office that hadn't learned yet how to handle the leads or how to train the agents to work with these leads. It seemed to me that the emphasis was on recruiting new agents, rather than leveraging the Carrington name and its potential leads. The fact that it seemed that many of the lead listings were in the hands of a few selected agents did not seem to foster the development and success of new agents. I strongly believe that Carrington has a very good working model; however, it lacks the culture or necessary individuals to implement its formula for growth and success"
"Specialist, Document, Sr.","Micro management, training can be improved, employees are not valued."
RE Sales Agent,"Carrington acquired my previous brokerage and I decided to stay because they presented all of these opportunities that, in theory, sounded amazing. Unfortunately, they were not executed well. I feel like the company was taking in too many new offices to focus on developing the ones that they acquired. I also like the ""family atmosphere"" of a local brokerage versus a huge company that is country wide.     In addition, I just had a baby and there were no offices that were close in proximity to my home. I am now working for a company that is a local brokerage and close to home. "
RE Sales Agent,I had to deal with some family issues.  
RE Sales Agent,No support from anyone 
"Loan Processor, Centralized, Sr.",The volume was slow. The income I was earning was not comparable to the previous job I left for Carrington due to the change in commission structure. The volume was not there to continue on churning 50+ month after month. The morale was low. The negativity starts from the same few processors and loan officers and spreads like wild fire almost everyday during the last few months I was there. I don't think the underwriter that received most of the full doc files was experienced at all to review full doc files. The UW depended too much on the UW manager to sign off on the condition which showed lack of knowledge to me on full doc files. I don't believe Carrington was ready to handle full doc files. These prompted me to entertain the offers I had on the table from my previous employers and previous management teams. 
"Analyst, Loss",The commute.  The location was 42 miles from my home.  It would take me up to 3.5 hours to get home in the evening due to the traffic.  I would work an 8+ hour day and be on the road for an additional 5 hours.  I had no quality of life.
"Loan Officer, Centralized",I loved Carrington and I wanted to stay but production pressures in Centralized left me with no choice. 
RE Sales Agent,"Required to pay a TC that did not offer the quality of assistance that I had been paying the same to an Independent TC I had used previously for several years.   I was led to believe that I would likely get REO assets when Carrington's training was completed. That never happened. My primary transactions from 2008-2014 were with several banks/servicers as one of their preferred listing and marketing REO agents, so I know I was well qualified to handle the Carrington available assets.  In addition to the above reasons, I went to a company that offers 100% commissions and still has online help and a Broker that is also available and an office with a conference room to meet clients in the event it is needed.  I work strictly at home paying for all supplies and I am self funded. I saw no need to give up 20% of my pay plus the TC fee that as it turned out was not helpful to me. I finally asked TC for a list of forms they wanted and generated myself and saw that they got acknowledged. I was paying a lot for a list.   My last two closing checks were late a week coming because the CDA had not been sent to escrow in time.   "
"Specialist, Tax",Dead end job. No raises. 
"Analyst, QC, Originations","I was given the opportunity to work from home 1-2 days a week.    The pay I was offered was 12.5% more than I was receiving at Carrington.    Other than that, I would have stayed as I feel Carrington is a great company to work for."
"Supervisor, Customer Service, CMS","A new call center manager came into the Westfield location.   On a regular basis this call center manager the little old the existing one as well as spoke poorly of Carrington mortgage services on a regular basis.   This individual made it clear she had a prior relationship on a professional level with the director Kirk Dugan and he would 'have her back' regardless of what happened.   I was berated, belittled, insulted by both the call center manager and the director.  I feared for my position. I spoke to Lillie and human resources. Lillie made it clear she has heard what I was experiencing by several other people and should not fear for my position.   Within a week of this meeting I was terminated. No basis was provided with the exception of telling me Indiana was an at will state and I could be terminated for no reason.   I had the highest performing team of new hires. I manage my team with integrity.   I am very disappointed with the integrity of Carrington mortgage services, their executive team, and human resource department."
RE Sales Agent,I wanted to branch off and created my own team.  
"Specialist, Servicing, SPOC","Your disregard for your employees and customers are the main reason why I left.  I actually watched CMS not review received docs to request for mortgage assistance package on a timely basis on accounts that I actually assisted the customer in getting in the docs. Documents that I knew WERE received by CMS on a timely basis because I RECEIVED them myself via email and sent them to imaging and the processor for review.  This lack of followup or blatten action put the loan into a sale and the homes of people who DID EVERYTHING asked of them in a timely manner was sold out from under them and they lost their homes.  A couple of those customers were elderly and had NO WHERE ELSE TO GO TO!!!! I will NOT WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT lies and deceives and cheats people out of their homes. I will not work for a company with no desire to help their customers. I also will not be treated as a piece of meat while working. My schedule had so many different days and hours off that I litterally had to have a calander on me at all times to be able to live the rest of my life.  Also, you were trying to find ways to cheat your reps out of their monthly bonuses. Also, every time we thought there was room for advancement or change of jobs we were locked into our present job and could not or were not allowed to put in for a change in positions.   "
RE Sales Agent,"I had an opportunity to open my own Real Estate Office in the Condominium Building where I live and I could not pass it up.    Also, it was beginning to be impossible to park in the lot in the strip mall where Carrington Sunny Isles is located because of a restaurant that takes up all the spaces.  I would come to the office and turn around because there were times when NO spaces were available.  Unlike other agents who work out of their homes. I liked going into the office.    "
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",Better opportunity different business line
RE Sales Agent,"The broker did not respond to numerous (5 or 6) emails, phone messages.  I received NO assistance in getting started with the Carrington program.  she was a joke - either she was over worked, incompertent, or she didn't work enough. "
RE Sales Agent,"Aiden Lynch, Broker was extremely difficult to reach 95% of the time. It was very frustrating and I did not feel as if I was a part of a Carrington team.  The additional fees that were constantly being deducted from my commissions were unbelievable for the amount of time and effort put in to sell a home.  I have been in real estate for over 22 years and have  never experienced such disrespect and lack of communication from a broker.  "
RE Sales Agent,"I felt that the agents, not just myself were not treated fairly. I went to my broker several times and voiced my concerns and was advised to stay quiet, and I had only a small view of the big picture. My opinion is that management above my broker has an attitude that the agent's don't matter and can and will be easily replaced and if an agent doesn't ""tow the line"", they are given an ultimatum . The only way for myself to treat agents with respect, dignity and professionalism is to do it myself as a broker. If you want me to be candid, here it is Jerry Stapp is a very good broker, but when his chain of command includes Pat Plourde and Mike Pinto , it sucks for everyone in the chain. "
"Specialist, Cash Operations",I appreciated the career opportunity that carrington provided me. One of the main factors that I left was lack of upward mobility in the company and also lack of pay scale in comparison to competitors. I also ran into a few issues with management as well. I do think Carrington has some great employees. I think if Carrington uses some of this constructive criticism it could benefit the company for future employees. 
RE Sales Agent,"The straw that broke the camel's back is when the broker did not pay dues to my association for a year and a half.  Carrington skated until Compliance caught it.  I notified Michelle Ridge, but she STILL did not pay dues for three months, then fibbed when I was leaving and said she mailed a check... but that was only the icing on the cake.    I was recruited in Oct. 2014 because a lender told me with my REO experience I would be a good fit with Carrington.  Initially that seemed the case and Allan McGurk was enthusiastic.  I have a varied background with many lenders in REO ranging from B of A to HUD and I also had experience with Nationstar now Xome and Hubzu, two of your institutional vendors.  However, it took almost ONE year to onboard me, and Catherine Milo never followed up with McGurk's inquiries.  In the meantime, we were losing listings to Allison James.  I was finally onboarded during the migration to Cascade, at which point Cascade told me that they had NO record of me.    The office for Carrington in San Jose is atrocious.  The carpets were not cleaned until I was leaving, we had no receptionist, the computers are outdated ( in Silicon Valley!!) , the office decor is sparse and not conducive to making calls, and clients would say ' This is It??? "" when they came in.  No phones, not enough flex computers or plug in stations. etc.  Initially I did not mind so much about the sparse setup, but the computers are two generations behind, IT is remote, and computers delete Google Chrome after every use.....etc.  Google Chrome is now used for many of the REO platforms.    Corporate is not any better.  Too many people who don't know what is going on.  I did a BPO and Allan accidentally sent the check to corporate, who cashed it then it took Accountng almost two months to reissue it to me.  I had to contact Dan Popadak.... then everyone finally jumped.  The infrastructure is much too slow to get anything done.    Larry White ticked off one of my vendors.... not sure what he did, but I was told by the vendor he led them on as they wanted to do a corporate deal with us and I set up a meeting in SF at a mixer.  He met with the CEO, made it sound like he was going to test SmartZip,  then later refused to let me be the test agent because he did not want to pay for my fees which I offered to pay back through escrow. He said that Corporate would not approve it, but then why lead everyone on for months?      Frankly, Carrington is making an unconscionable 35% on institutional REOs plus the split for doing almost nothing.... the money goes to the bottom line.      I don't think anything will change anytime soon.  You can't recruit good REO agents like myself because of the corporate setup, poor infrastructure and bad office setup.  The San Jose office is like a morgue, and no one knows who the heck we are one of the top markets in the country.    I still am owed a measly $39  reimbursement for a lockbox that the contractor took, no matter how many times the asset mgr has sent the request in.  Someone keeps REJECTING the reimbursement.    We never even had regular sales meetings, the broker of record does not even know correct compliance that you need a disclosure for water heater,smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors....    Carrington has HUGE problems that prevent the company from graduating to a hgher level. There is a lot of  potential, but when I hear that agents who have poor scorecards caused suspension of assignments, I don't even receive assignments for almost a year and the brokers, managers and office leaders move at a snail's pace, I don't know how the company can fix the numerous issues that bring the company down.    After saying all this, you probably won't want me back even if you fixed your problems, but the leadership, especially on the West Coast and Corporate needs to be reexamined.  "
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",terrible quality and quantity of leads and pay structure cut. Lots of companies are structured far better. I see Carrington as unstable. 
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","My mother, who lived in Toronto, Canada, was ill and I needed to go to spend time with her and help with her care.  Unfortunately, she passed away on May 8, 2016."
"Specialist, Bankruptcy, II",The department I was in was moved to Texas. Moving expenses are not covered and no one could tell me if I was going to be laid off or moved to another department.  Felt I was left in the dark about my future at Carrington. I had only been there a few months before it was decided my department would be moving. I would have stayed at my last job had i known. Rather than wait for a surprise lay off I chose to make the decision to leave and take control of my employment fate. 
"Supervisor, Loan Servicing","There are several reasons I left Carrington.  I completed an exit interview with Niky Polychronopoulos so feel free to refer to her notes for more information.  First off I moved to Ohio to work for Carrington.  I gave up my whole life and family in another state for this job only to find out after being there a few short weeks that it was the worst job of my life.  Carrington is the shadiest most unorganized company I have ever worked for.  The first few months were fine but then they hired Fran Schaut.  This man is a complete idiot.  He only got the job because he must be best friends with Bob Warren.  He didn't know anything.  Several times I would try to speak to him he would turn his nose up at me and keep moving till he found a male to speak to.  He would come out of his office looking specifically for men to answer his question and wouldn't give a female the time of day.  I had to chat with him on two occasions about customer situations that turned into him yelling me and telling me what an idiot I was for lack of better words.  He doesn't know how to lead or give feedback.  He is one of the worst managers I have ever worked for.  He decided on 12/31/15 that he would send an email to the floor stating that schedules would be changing and offered no more info than just that.  When I left in late April the schedules still weren't changed.  The man cant make a decision to save his life.  When he was told that people were going to leave since he couldn't provide more info or an eta on schedule changes he replied with ""good.""  Again, something you don't do as a leader but after knowing how Carrington operated he fits in well.          The biggest reason I left Carrington was because of my immediate supervisor Cale.  We heard great things about Cale prior to him arriving and we quickly realized they were just rumors.  He's the more arrogant man I have ever met in my life.  He is the worst leader I have ever had the chance to work for.  He would bring a bible to work and while he coached you or gave you bad feedback would tell you he was a Christian man and tried to do the right thing.  He played favorites (specifically with the black female sups and male sups).  I personally think he was afraid of the black females.  There were several occasions that he would tell confidential information to one of my peers that I told to him about one of their agents.  He would brush off information we told him as it related to associate performance on the floor.  I had one particular associate be down right disrespectful to me on multiple occasions and then the agent decided to go to Cale and complain about me.  The agent created some lies that I was able to prove were lies and Cale decided to write me up based on the stories he was told.  He told me that at his old job he was known for writing up the most sups.  This should say a lot about Cale - that he cant lead or coach.  You shouldn't spend time writing up sups you should coach them.  Upon being written up I felt like there was a target on my back.  Cale would find things to ""yell"" at me for or ""talk to me about"" that I wasn't doing correctly even though prior to the write up he never mentioned them.  I felt as though I was being singled out and would be fired soon.  For this specific situation I had shared some issues I had with the agent and some conversations the agent and I had and Cale brushed them off and wouldn't address the behavior.  He then told a black female peer of mine that he wrote me up and she shared that with the agent with whom I had difficulties with.  While I was there we switched up teams and managers and I remained on Cale's team, myself and another white female supervisor who I feel was also on the radar.  I believe he kept us on his team so that he could ensure we got fired.  I often shared with him how much Carrington meant to me since I moved my whole life here for this job and his response would be ""ehhh maybe this isn't the job for you.""  I have over 12 years call center experience, over 6 years in leadership experience and over 5 years of mortgage experience.  Only an idiot would make that kind of statement.  I should have been doing Cale's job because he clearly cant do it.  I am still very frustrated with myself that I left Chase to come to Carrington.  I don't ""job hop"" and I made a very big decision in my life to come to Carrington only to leave about 9 months into my tenure there.  This is so out of character for me and I am frustrated I left but I am very happy I left.  I could go on and on but bottom line - Carrington unfortunately is employing some very awful untrustworthy leaders and the biggest one being Cale.  He is the main reason I left this company.  I am soooooooooo happy I left and leaving was the best decision I have ever made.  During my time there was I was starting to have health issues and upon leaving I have never felt better.  I work for a leader who supports me and a company who appreciates their employees.  I am sorry I had to provide such a lengthy negative email but it needs to be said.  Like I said earlier I could go on and on about all the awful things going on there and what I encountered while I was there but I will leave it at this.  Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss any items I wrote about. 4196182369"
"Loan Officer, Centralized","1.  The new lead management system is an absolute joke.  2.  The dialer is a joke.  What do you think happens when you call the same people 20-30 times?  You burn these people out and you piss them off.  3.  A new portfolio hasn't been purchased in over 18 months and you added 100 additional LO's.  That only chews through the remaining leads faster and faster.  4.  You cut the comp and promised that it was because we were going to be busier than ever.  We were going to have so many leads that we would all be funding more loans than ever before.  You cut the comp 3 months before even implementing the horrible new lead system, and before introducing new leads for us to work.  5.  The phone NEVER rings with inbound calls.  Those all go to IN and FL.  6.  Dennis Hueman is a joke.  Get rid of that guy.  He is ruining your company.  7.  No new leads.  8.  No new leads for 18+ months.  9.  No new leads.  10.  You lied to us and to new hires about securing new leads when there weren't actually any new leads."
"Analyst,Loan Servicing,Quality Assurance","My pay was not fair, based on my experience and value I brought to my team. When I spoke to management they were unwilling to increase my wages. "
RE Sales Agent,I felt that dealing with foreclosure was very time consuming & I was concerned with my safety going in some of the foreclosed houses ...nothing is worth more than my life 
"Specialist, Loan Set-Up, RegSalesCtr,II",The reason I left Carrington was because I felt like I didn't have the opportunity for career growth when management changed.
"Specialist, Closing, CTS","Poor leadership, starting with upper management . Very obvious the company does not care for employees. Absolutely no training, the little training received was not enough for the expectations given. Every person I worked with at Carrington feels the same way. "
"Loan Processor, Branch, Sr.",I had no pipeline the entire time I was there. I barely closed any loans. All I heard around me was how much  more money everyone was making. My manager was no help to me. I posted for another position in Retail and wasn't given the position even after I interviewed for it hr stated there was a hiring freeze and no clue of an end date on it. I sat there with no work while other depts could've used my help. I then excepted a position at another employer and have my notice only to be told I could leave the same day. I am a hard worker and only wanted to work but Carrington did need me.
RE Sales Agent,"My husband was solicited with an email by Adrian Petrila because of his many years of listing REO properties.  Joe decided to make an appointment and I came with him, after a few meetings we decided to join Carrington. We were told their was a sign-on bonus for joining but was told we miss the cut off time by a few days and he wouldn't honor it.  I have never worked so hard with any RE Broker with mandatory webinars and taking classes on line then test after test with no results. I have had my RE license since 1990 and have never seen anything like your company in all my life. Waiting weeks to get paid. #Ridiculous.....The office isn't appropriate to bring clients to, which we were told the office was only temporary. Not at all an upscale business. We gave up a big percentage of our commission to accept your company's lower commission only because of the opportunity for the REO's.  I decided to leave and my husband decided to stick it out with CRES but Adrian said if I leave Joe can't stay. Again, I have never seen where a RE brokers feels he has the right to claim both husband and wife. At the Christmas party we meet a husband and wife agents and the wife works for CRES as a REO agent and her husband worked for someone different.  Adrian said they made an acception for them.  I am very happy we left Carrington."
"Representative, Customer Research, CMS","When I first started Carrington in October of 2014 there was a group of 30 or so call center employees.  It was a great place to work with a great comradery among the group. I went with the move from Fishers to the Westfield Indiana office.  When I left the call center in August of 2015 it was still a great place.  I then moved to the research department at Carrington.  My enjoyment of my work quickly went away.  I worked 10 hrs overtime every week because we had so much of a workload.  That lasted from August 2015 until January 2016. What caused my lack of wanting to work for Carrington was the preferential treatment between the supervisors and some of the workers in the Research Department.  Some could easily get time off, others never got approval no matter the workload or time available. The final straw for me was when my daughter had to spend 2 days in the hospital for a surgery.  Even though I had over 2 wks of earned PTO, I was only able to take one day.  I would have understood had there been a huge workload or others had requested the time off but no one had.  There was no one who was taking the time off the second day I needed.  When I brought this up to my supervisor I was told they ""may need me to help with payoffs"". Please understand a research representative and payoff representative are 2 separate paid roles even though I did help out as needed.  I felt my willingness to help the department above and beyond my job punished me in by not being able to spend time with my family at a time when my daughter really needed me. "
RE Sales Agent,"My wife and I were recruited by Adrian Petrila and were told that we would each receive about 30 REO properties a year.  We had been working for Realty World for 5 years and listed about 35-40 Freddie Mac assets annually.  In the 10 1/2 months that we were with Carrington we completed all the REO training but only received 3 REO listings and sold 2 of the 3.  We feel that the time that we spent with Carrington was a huge waste of time and regret our decision to go with the company.  In our opinion, the company’s commission structure is one of the worst in Southwest Florida and we were tired of giving a large percentage of our commission to the broker for so little in return.  We would never recommend Carrington Real Estate Services to anyone."
RE Sales Agent," I was mislead and promised several things that were not so. I was told Carrington would provide my flyers, I'd have a better split... Never told I'd pay for Boomtown... Terrible experience and the corporate trainers were great at presenting but no follow through.  "
"Specialist, Special Servicing","There were several reason why I left Carrington.     1) Management was very unprofessional. The manager, Justin Covington encouraged the reps in SSD to ""swope"" loans from one another which caused a very hostile work environment. Reps don't like each other, they make it known on the floor, the foul language on the floor is ridiculous.     2) The things that went on in that dept, from people being handed deals due to favoritism, from management bad mouthing his reps and lead to me. This place is full of drama. I knew from the 2nd week I was there it was a very unprofessional place with management (in the department I was in) had no integrity.     3) I also had an incident where the customer was in foreclosure, my supervisor advised me we can accept $3000 as a full payoff. This lady was unemployed, had no money, sold everything she had and came up with the money. Justin Covington came to my desk and told me to ask her for $5k, I advised him of her situation and of how my supervisor Rick Rodriguez told me I can accept $3k. The borrower had $3k, and could not come up with the rest. He started to laugh and said ""I don't give a sit, I can foreclose on the home and get $11k"".  I don't think a borrower's situation is a laughing matter. I don't think it is ok to tell the borrower one thing and go back on it.     4) I fell ill while working there due to stress and decided for personal reason I needed to leave along with the fact that it was just not a good fit. I should have known by the chatter in the break room by all of the unhappy employees but, I like to make my own judgments. "
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",I left Carrington because it is not my career job. I wanted to start my career so found a job that started it for me. Carrington was a good place to work at be it that the people who works there made it easier.
RE Sales Agent,Office is to far from my home.
RE Sales Agent,Territory diference
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","I didn't like the change in scheduling, I wasn't told before I was hired that I would calling customers to collect a debt starting the second of the month "
"Underwriter, Loss Mitigation, II","The new UW manager in the home retention department was very disrespectful to me and I didnt feel the need to be treated that way. I loved my job, just couldnt compromise my integrity.  I wouldnt mind coming back to Carrington if Giovanni V.  is no longer there. "
RE Sales Agent,"I was disrespected repeatedly by this company over and over again, the last straw was reached by me.  The Newly appointed Area Broker disrespected me on a level that was not going to be tolerated by me.  Dishonesty is something I will not put up with from a Broker, he got caught in his lies by Carrington's own Vendor.  WOW!!!  Which also reminded me why was I working for someone I never even met in person?  Crazy.  In addition, your accounting department is disorganized and I was paid at the wrong percentage and then the length of time was unacceptable to wait for the corrections was over a month.      The list can go on and on.  I would tell anyone who ever thinks about going to  Carrington to RUN!!!! do not walk. RUN FOREST RUN!!!!!"
RE Sales Agent,"Real Estate has gotten too computer oriented for me. I am old school and prefer one on one, face to face relationships. Also, I was just not in the mood to put up with all the corporate BS."
"Trainee, Loan Officer, I",Relocated 
RE Sales Agent,I had been offered a position with a company that does Reverse mortgages. My goal is to do reverse and residential listings. I would hope that the door would still be open after I become versed in Reverses.
"Loan Officer, Branch, Outside",Limited office space availability.
"Manager, District",I left because my job was ending on 5/31
"Coordinator, Recruiting","Zero opportunity for growth. Management refusal to invest adequate time and money in its strongest employees. Bonuses/ICP based on job title rather than performance. Lack of perks/incentives. Internal audit reported violations i did not commit. Poor performance review system. Lack of appreciation. Getting written up for the behavior of others.  Other than that, my time at Carrington was perfect."
RE Sales Agent,I was misled about the structure of the company in regards to the lead center and commission structure. 
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","I left carrington, because the supervisors had attitudes when you would ask for assistance. Also, I feel that the company didn't care about their employees."
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",I believe that CMS is unethical and didn't care about their customers.  I feel like CMS lacked organization. 
RE Sales Agent,Because it is hard no to have a local office .  And the Commission structure is really low.
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",Carrington model does not allow me to grow my business. I wanted to work in environment that was supportive and proactive. I also felt that we where not paid enough. The commission structured changed. 
"Loan Officer, Branch, Inside",I am moving to North Carolina and there is not an office close to my residence.
RE Sales Agent,"I left Carrington because of the fees.  I was nickle and dimed over transaction fees to include having to pay a full transaction fee on an REO sale in which I made the company over $4k.  This is not a company for experienced agents - I made the company over $17k in one year and they lost me over $400...I moved to an agency that promotes growth for their agents and not taking money from them.  The fuel fee is a joke, and the admin fee is higher than others.  Very disappointed that I joined and glad that I left.  Usha Cheriathundam was my broker I contacted and she did a very good job in supporting my business - but being that I would have to explain everything about Carrington to my clients as no on knew who Carrington was.  The fees charged are in line with RE/MAX who I left and wish I never had.  The marketing money that was promised never was given or no lenders were interested in partaking.  Boomtown is a waste of money and provided 0 results.  My current broker charges a flat fee of $295 for each closing and that is it...just gave myself a $17k raise!  You will not make it in our market place with the fees you charge agents."
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",I was fired due to attendance.which I'm still not completely understanding when I got a write-up for the issue still under 6 points and was fired a week later.personally the new attendance policy is a hoax other than that I have nothing bad to really say about Carrington it was a great learning experience and I appreciate it
"Loan Processor, Regional Sales Center, I",base salary too low 
"Representative, Customer Research, CMS","I live an hour away from the office. Once I had my baby, it did not makes sense to drive that far to work everyday.   I was also working an 11-8 shift, so my daughter would have been in daycare from about 9:30am until 8-9pm and more than half of my pay would have gone to paying for her daycare.    Additionally, my department (Customer Research) was EXTREMELY understaffed and overworked. We had mandatory overtime most days and were not allowed to take time off. I even had high BP during the end of my pregnancy due to the work overload. I was not even allowed to take off work early and was treated poorly because my doctor would keep me home from work in order to keep my BP down.     The department supervisors majorly played favorites and if you were not one of them, you were treated like a kindergartener. I did not feel as if I was treated like an adult while working at CMS... I felt as though I was back in high school. The drama was ridiculous.     Most importantly, the pay structure was INSANE. The fact that the customer service representatives made more money than those in the research department was insane to me. We made only $1 more an hour but did not get bonuses and we worked a lot harder to fix the mistakes they had made while on the phone with customers.    Lastly, I believe the culture of CMS Westfield was not at all professional. (There would be employees smoking marijuana in the parking lot on their breaks/lunches, employees wearing extremely inappropriate attire, employees being extremely rude to borrowers, the list goes on.)"
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","1) I left Carrington because the Commission Structure had a severe decrease on Refinances. It went from .75 bps to .40 bps. All the Loans in my Pipeline were Refinances.  Carrington customer loans are very difficult to get to Funding, including a Streamline Loan. I already was making 50-100% less than Peers at other Mortgage Co's in town, so with the smaller loan sizes, difficult loans, this decrease was very unfortunate.   2) Puchase Leads had no quality to them. The Borrowers had Fico in 400 - 550 range, no down payment.  With FHA tightening up on their Guidelines, it's very hard to serve the Underserved.   3) I found it very difficult to capture any Realtors to get Referrals from because the Borrower and Realtors were typical very unhappy with the difficulty of Closing the loan, and missing close of escrow.   4) The Loan Officer job is more than 40 hours per week, and the Co said no overtime.   5) Hearing about the Hiring Freeze when the Office was supposed to be at 30-40 Loan Officers by December 2015, and it was Co wide, made me concerned about how Carrington was being run.   6) Carrington needs better Health insurance and a 401 k Plan.     If I hear that the Office is running smoother, with decent Leads, and Pay Plan, I would consider going back to Carrington.      "
"Underwriter, Retail Branch, Sr.","I was a re-hire and Carrington had been reaching out to me for several months to come back to work for them and I had not returned any of their calls because I knew the type of environment this company had.  Eventually I finally gave in and it ended up being the worst decision I have ever made in my life.  After meeting with the underwriting manager Rich Anderson which I personally never worked with in the past but we did cross paths when I left the company the first time re-assured me that some of the issues in the underwriting dept from before had been addressed and all is well.  I then met with Pam (Rich's boss and she convinced me how the climate at Carrington was so much better as she had once left in the past for the same reason's.  Well from the very beginning it was nothing but negativity and stress throughout the department and company.  There was no true sense of leadership and no one respected the leadership or new what was ever going on at any given time.  I was only there for 4 months and I could never get my manager team lead, my manager's boss, IT or anyone to obtain the basic general sign-ons that any underwriter would require at any job and anytime I would inquire about then I would be look upon as a trouble maker.  Now mind you others were hired in after me and got all general basic sign-ons and any other tools needed to complete there job but not me.  About 1 month after I stated they hired another U/W manager by the name of Kathy Upchurch and that's when things really went bad quickly because she came in made a personal assessment about each of us and treated us accordingly and did not keep it professional.  I did not care that this women did not like me personally, I had a problem with her difference of treatment.  so she decided that she was going to use the fact that I did not have basic sign-ons that should have been provided to me when I first started and the fact that I had medical issues that that I had appointments that I had already spoken to mngt about as a reason to eventually drive me out of there, so she thought, but I had already decided that there was no way I could ever work with such an incompetent unprofessional personal that a company will always back up no matter what.  This is just a very condescended version as to normal day to day things that goes on at Carrington that makes people no longer ever want to work for such a company again.  I am sure my one little story will not change anything about how you handle business but I hope that this at least gets someone to thinking about it.  "
"Director,  Financial Reporting","The senior level and executive management were the worst I've ever encountered.  Specifically, accounting and finance!  They lie and cheat employees out of legitimately earned bonuses and never provide COLA adjustments or raises.  The environment is terrible and depressed.  Employees feel trapped instead of inspiration, desperation instead of gratitude.  Too much to list!    The positive side is that I'm no longer there.  Thank god!    I hope this helps.    "
"Representative, Customer Research, CMS","The drive and traffic was getting too stressful and difficult to make it to work on time.  When CMS moved to Westfield, that added over 20 minutes additional time to my commute on a good day. That increase in time and mileage was a paycut due to added time and auto maintenance. CMS not having a 401k made it feel like they were not willing to invest in my future which made it feel like I was not appreciated. The department I worked in kept promising a pay increases which never came.  Furthermore the mandatory overtime on specific days made it difficult to plan outside work activities. At the time I was there a hiring freeze between departments which restricted career path changes. This is what made me look outside of the company as I needed more income and had given CMS enough time to make change that never happened. "
RE Sales Agent,I wanted more of a boutique company and I did not want to be involved with REO properties.  I also wanted a higher commission rate.
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",Two words: Ryan Higley
"Specialist, Servicing, SPOC",I left to care for my son who needs my time to overcome some challenges he is going through and my work schedule didn't allow me to be there for him.
RE Sales Agent,"Great company, great people, I was very happy during my stay and learned a lot. Another opportunity came up with an old friend and a took the chance. Also, I had some location problems, parking was a problem and my clients complained about it too. It is hard to focus or call when you have to remember to move your car or you get a ticket or when you have to drive 15-30 minutes looking for a parking space. Sometimes even the lot across the street was full. "
"Loan Officer, Centralized, Senior","Lack confidence in Dennis Human, new SR VP. 95% of loan agents in Anaheim don't relate to him "
"Underwriter, Wholesale, Team Lead","I left Carrington because number one, my health went down hill.  I had to go on blood pressure medication.  I was required to work when it was not needed neglecting my family, even though I was the top underwriter.  I was never praised, always received demeaning e mails.  The money was great, my quality of life was not.  No one in management cared except for Jen Rocha, who had already left. My leaving was the best thing I had ever done for myself and my family.  I now wake up loving to go to work and being appreciated for the amazing work that I do.  And the personal experience for an employee to get a loan was horrible.  I am refinancing now to get out of Carrington's less than acceptable servicing"
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside",Work environment had became negative and the restructuring of compensation.   
RE Sales Agent,"I left because your contracts with you agents are unconscionable. You lie and mislead agents and over work and under pay them. Your management has no ethics and you literally stole $20k in commission from my Daughter and I, which I am still contemplating filing a law suit on. I have worked with Nationstar and their Managemnt for years and they is no comparison to the great people there and your management. We are doing fantastic at my new broker and if it wasn't for the fact that you did the wrong you did we wouldn't have moved offices, so it all worked out to our benefit! "
"Specialist, Servicing, SPOC",I left Carrington because there was a lot of drama between peer and superiors. A lot of changes happened where I thought Carrington was really not pro-employee. It was more on the business look rather than employee and business. It was a hostile work environment to me and to many other who still work or worked there. It was a good pay but really it wasn't worth the stress it put in my worklife. Being in Carrington felt like being in high school. I dreaded coming to work. 
"Specialist, Collateral",My supervisor did not help me to grow within the company even though I wanted to stay in CMS. Although I commented her that I wanted to apply for another position she did not give me feedback and it was not until I told her that I was leaving that she got back to me.
RE Sales Agent,"The communication was nil. I would call on behalf of customers underwater & I would not get an answer from short sale section after numerous emails & calls. I was trying to help these people. The commission structure is bad on REO . I had an occupied REO with 6 months of work. It sold @ auction for $143,00 & I received $250. I had an REO before I left I was to split the commission with another agent. I never got it with many calls to Seth Lesselbaum to no avail, maybe  you can help. "
"Specialist, Servicing, SPOC","    On this date, February      2016 please accept this written correspondence as my formal two-week notice of resignation. I regret to inform that I am leaving CMS to pursue a new opportunity that will better fit me and my family. I came to CMS with no call center or mortgage experience. In my year at CMS I have learned a lot about the mortgage industry and I have excelled in my SPOC role both individually and as a team member. I started with CMS with a minimum of a five year plan because growth and opportunity were stressed in my interview. I was given a schedule choice and went with what worked for my family best. Since my start with CMS there has been an ongoing uncertainty in direction of the SPOC role and department as a whole. In less than one year I have experienced a company move and within weeks of my start date a schedule change. A second schedule change came recent with Saturday's added in which we were notified in the form of an email at 5:00 pm on New Years Eve. Also, in recent weeks many continuous changes and changes to changes have been taking place at rapid pace in SPOC. These changes have come with no clear direction as to what to expect, continuous job role/description changes and not to mention a severe lack of communication. I strongly feel lack of communication, organization and inconsistency is a huge issue not only in SPOC but across the servicing department. The continuous changes and addition of nearly 20 employees to SPOC has raised concern for our potential income going forward. An internal freeze has prevented individuals as myself to stay with the company and feel as we are being forced out. A quote from our manager directly ""I hate to see any of you go,but I understand if you cannot make it work."" Meetings between reps and managers and managers with managers have been on going for weeks. At the end of the day we are all humans and not robots and have a life and family aside from CMS and at some point there needs to be a balance or the good employees who would rather grow with a company and now not provided the opportunity will begin to leave. Employees are feeling undervalued and easily replaceable. This has become apparent when we have been asked about our questions and concerns. With all of that being said, my current SPOC position has become no longer conducive to myself or my family.  I greatly appreciate the opportunity.  "
"Specialist, Servicing, SPOC",Due to illness that I was advised may take up to six weeks to heal along with new attendance policy I decided to resign to stay in good standing with Carrington.
RE Sales Agent,"I feel that everything was a lie by Carrington and Jerry Stapp.  First of all, Your ad said you will supply leads, and I was recruited on the idea that Carrington would supply leads, and they will take a larger portion of the commission, but that was OK by me. Then Jerry asked me to buy signs, so I will have them when I receive the leads. So I done that. Then I was asked to buy open house signs, and portion of that - $ 99 for a starter kit- will be paid back to me. I bought the signs, and submitted the receipt, then I was promised for a refund, but I have not received the $ 99 back. Altogether I spent over $ 600 on signs. Then I was asked to take all the online classes that I will need before I can receive assignments. I took all the classes, well over 40 different online classes. Then on a meeting after that I asked Jerry: when can I start receiving leads, and he said, there will not be any leads assigned to new agents for some time. ... Bottom line: EVERYTHING was a lie. The recruiting ad promising leads, the manager dangled the carrot on the idea of getting leads, I was asked to buy signs, and promised a refund, and NONE OF THEM promises was true. I didn't mind working for an unknown name Carrington, because I thought you will jumpstart my work with leads, but after all the misrepresentation, I felt that I don't want to work with a company who is base their business model on lies."
"Accountant, Staff, CPS","I left Carrington because I was bored. I felt that I was overpaid for the tasks assigned to me, and there was no opportunity to develop or increase my contribution to the company. The promotion opportunities within accounting are non existent. Our department hadn't gotten raises in 5 years."
"Auditor, Vendor Site","I left carrington mtg because I wasn't given the proper necessities for success.  I'll elaborate more.     I was hired on fresh off of unemployment. My manager expected me to use my credit cards (which were maxed out do to me being unemployed) to book my flight, rental car, and all other expenses. Not to mention he wanted me to book 4 appointments scheduled out over 4 to 6weeks. Who has the money/credit availability for that when you're  fresh off of unemployment???? I expressed that to him on numerous occasions and he didn't seem to care. My only option was to resign from my position. "
"Loan Officer, Centralized","Everything seemed like a big secret, everything changed constantly, there was no training at all.  Good people but bad practices as far as leading a group of people. "
RE Sales Agent,Moved out of the area
"Specialist, Servicing, SPOC",I left because the management in the spoc department were rude nasty and mirco micro managers.I wittness one of the managers acting  inappropriately with the director over the department. I believe that is why she was so rude and nasty toward everyone.
"Loan Officer, Regional Sales Ctr, Inside","Corporate cut our commission rate twice since I started and it went from 95bps to 40bps.  Your focus was moving toward purchases and you NEVER close on-time, which hurts my reputation as a loan officer."
RE Sales Agent,"Have leukemia, stage two. Not working full time any more. Can't be around large groups with compromised immune system. I needed a company that would provide leads. Not that interested in REO sales.  Staff, support and training were outstanding.     I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. Big company with small company feel.    I am doing more free lance writing than real estate these days. I do not regret my time with Carrington in the least. Your Boomtown program is ideal for real estate.    Best wishes for your continued success. "
"Analyst, Application Support, II",There was an opportunity that came up that best fit my future goal as a Business Systems Analyst.
"Specialist, Loss Mitigation",I left Carrington to a full time mom.
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",I left Carrington because my current job is closer to where I live.  I'm 10 minutes away from my current job.
"Specialist, Post Close, Team Lead, MLD",The only reason i left Carrington is to move up north to live with my boyfriend and be cIoser to my family. I loved working for Carrington Mortgage and hoping to find a position in the area I have relocated to. 
RE Sales Agent,"I did not feel supported by the company and did not feel that the company provided the tools necessary to conduct business. Our office, for example, did not have a color printer in the times when most other brokerages provide top-notch high-end services. The change in management was discouraging also. The file processor was not helpful either. The office had completely lacked any sense of camaraderie and after six months of being on-board, I did not know the names of any of my co-workers... I probably would not recognize them if I saw them on the street either. I was really excited to join Carrington in the beginning but found the brokerage to be disappointing to say the least. I had become a top-producer at my current brokerage since leaving and most of it could be attributed to the fact that I actually enjoy going to the office, feel appreciated and know that my brokerage actually cares about me and my business."
RE Sales Agent,"I joined the company because I was told that the company has a very good support team, especially to new agent. In addition, the company has listing which provides good opportunity for a new agent to learn.  I have spent a lot of hours to get my training done and to be certified. But it turned out that the company's listings were assigned to those selected agents. I finally got a REO listing after one of the experienced agent rejected it. I went to take the pictures during raining day in an abandoned property  which resulting in pictures were not clear. Because of this my expenses for lockbox and rekey were rejected. The property later was sold in an auction, and my lockbox was broken. It was a very horribly experience, I did not get any help from anyone even I repeatedly asked for help.  I don't mind to pay 40% of my commission to the company, but at least I need to get reasonable support.  All good REO assignments were assigned to those favorite agents.   I am very happy with where I am now. My current company is more friendly. I got more help, generate more business and keep more commission for myself."
RE Sales Agent,"It did not feel the same after Dan Depies was let go.  We were shifted to another office in Tampa, where our experience was downplayed.  Felt like I was starting over after 5 years with the company and I was required to jump through hoops to get  REO properties that never came.  Emphasis was on lead generation for greenlight mortgage so that I could get properties that cost more time and gas than what was earned in commission.      There was strong emphasis on getting traditional listings  and sales...which is fine...but why deal with 80/20 split and a  transaction coordinator  when all was left up to me?          "
RE Sales Agent,"Did not have strong support from my Office Broker . Did not answer my my requests in a timely manner. On the few occasions I needed a timely input (say within 24 Hrs, few days went by without he acknowledging my requests. "
"Loan Processor, Branch, II",Horrible training.  No one directly in the office who knew anything about what I did-Processing.
"Specialist, Servicing, SPOC","I had left my current position in the SPOC department due to the inconvenience of the change in hours and days that were to take place as of February first 2016. These hours and days I would not be able to meet. I was not able to change my schedule in that time frame, nore could I work on Saturdays. I have requested Saturdays off due to religous obervance and would not be able to work any Saturdays. I was told by the department manager if i can not meet the companys schedule then best to part ways, the company would not change. I had no choice on the matter and had to quite come the last day of the month of January. I enjoyed my job and worked hard to do well, working with others and excel. Unfortunately,  the company would not work with me on the matter. I leave the company with a Thank you for the opportunity given to me. "
"Manager,Inside Sales, Retail Bus Develop","Two major reasons.   1: the product line for a loan officer in the bay area, particularly in the south bay and north bay where loan amounts tend to be beyond the 625k loan amounts, Carrington does not have any competitive products to offer clients. Jumbo pricing is way out of market and also no 2nd mortgage resources to offer clients a viable option of doing a combo loan to get into these higher loan amounts since the jumbo pricing is poorly priced.    2: paying commissions only once a month. do to the fact that an LO can only be paid once per month for commissions, it subject the LO to a higher tax rate when those commissions are received which equates into a much lower net income. My first commission check was a gross of 28k and I only took home half of that. I guess if you are a low producing LO it would not affect you as much but for me, this was a deal breaker.    I believe Carrington has a great model and works great for lower priced markets but it's just not a viable option for the bay area where loan limits typically exceed 625k. If you fix these two things, it would allow Carrington to capture a greater market share in the Bay Area"
"Loan Processor, Branch, Sr.","There are so many reasons...    1.  Underwriting staff who believe it is their job to make it as difficult to approve every loan that they see.  Files are over conditioned - which is bizarre since CMS services it's own loans.  The company I have left for is a lender, but sells most of their loans to investors - and I have far fewwer conditions on my loans now.  The first loan I processed at my new company was a manual UW, USDA purchase, which I received back from UW with the only approval condition being ""Needs USDA approval.""  In 4 months with this new company, I have averaged 20 loans closed per month. I never hit half that at CMS in ANY month.      2.  Underwriters approach every interaction with Sales and Processing with an adversarial attitude.  Constantly heard ""We're all working as a team.""  Underlying that was ""But we're so much better than you, and you'll play by our rules.""  Just some wisdom - Sales drives the bus.  If your Loan Originators can't close loans, you're not making any money.  Everyone else -in ANY mortgage company - is there to support that mission.  Not obstruct it.    3.  Management who provided conflicting and mixed messages.  Every day, I would hear from those above me how we were the greatest group of Processors - but we still sucked.  WE weren't closing enough loans, we weren't submitting enough ""quality files"" to Underwriting, we were screwing up the CD's and costing huge amounts of money to CMS becasue of cost to cures.    4.  LO's who have no idea how to actually put a file together.  No, your borrower can't provide me handwritten reciepts for cash rent payments in lieu of an actual VOR.  And no, a letter explaining he had $1,000 in ""Mattress Money: for his down payment isn't going to work either.    5.  Lack of a clear chain of command.  I was a branch processor.  Did I report to the branch manager who hired me - she seemed to think so - or did I report to the Regional Processing Supervisor and the RVP?      6.  The Closing Disclosure process.  I have queried my former employers, and now I am working for a new employer and NONE of them have Processors producing final CD's.  They all have their Closing Departments handling that.  Want to know why?  Because Closers have been producing HUD-1 Settlement statements since...well, forever.  They know how to produce closing documents, including the CD, and they have experience interacting with closing agents.  Providing 4 hours of a webinar training on how to produce a CD, then expecting perfection from Processors who have never produced closing documents of that type is setting your staff up to fail.  Blaming them for it afterwards is just demoralizing.    7.  Work hours.  I was given a cell phone and a laptop when I began work and was told in no uncertain terms I was to be available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.  Prior to vacations, I would often work until 10 or 11 pm the night before to make sure everything was as done as possible, because  there would be no back-up from any other processors  to cover my workload.  On my last two vacations, I wasn't two hours into my vacation before my personal cell phone started ringing and pinging with calls and text messages.  The holiday situation is ridiculous.  Publising a holiday schedule that everyone knows is going to be changed 3 weeks befoer the holiday comes up is unfair to employees.  I'm just curious...Christmas is on a Sunday this year.  IS Ray goign to send out an email on Decemebr 1st telling everyone they're just not meeting their goals and Decemebr 26 is now a wok day (of course, everyone will get paid double time,,,so there's that.)"
"Manager, Branch, Ramp-Up Producing",I could not get loans closed in a timely manner & hit closing dates.  Communication between was almost non-existent between sales. processing & UW.  i have been in the mortgage industry for 15 years. This was by far the worst company I have   ever been associated with in terms of the loan process & experience from start to closing.
"Loan Processor, RegionalSalesCenter, II",Empty promises.  Treated people poorly and not professionally. Expectations higher than what a person was getting paid. Expected work to come before an outside life. Expected to pick up other people's slack and those people not managed up or out. Talked down to. Got yelled at in front of others. There is a time and place for those types of discussions. Basically the people running the show didn't seem to have morales. I managed for 12 years and would never disrespect my staff or make promises that I couldn't follow thru on.  Wanted to work for someone else there and ended up with a GREEN manager.  I will say that Clintom Alcorn is a class act man and would work for him any day of the week. 
"Loan Processor, Regional Sales Center, I","I was promised at home access and then it did not happen, I live too far to work in house. "
RE Sales Agent,1st off. I was offered at least 3-4 REO properties a month. I only got 2 really bad ones  in the whole time I was with the company which 1 was a bit overpriced. I really work hard on the 2nd one (the overpriced one) and the end result. The money is really not there at all. $455.00 take home after 3 months of back and forth going to the city permit and zoning dept. Also. When there is a problem with the asset. You have to call the the customer dept for Carrington in California that no one answers or calls back. If you are lucky. You might get 1 call back out of numerous calls attempts days after you resolve the problem on your own. I think the company could use quite a bit more human touch and a little less virtual/computer communication. This is ment in a very professional manner for the perpouse of constructive criticism not to offend anyone as I am a professional. Thanks. 
RE Sales Agent,"I left because I did not have the means to afford the MLS at the time. After discussing that with the broker I was offered a very low commission structure as a ""Referral"" agent. With my understanding, the broker or the powers to be can give a more decent commission structure. With that said, there is no set rule of commissions paid because of your status ""Referral"" agent. All I wanted was a fresh start. So I decided to take my talents else where and it works for me.    "
RE Sales Agent,"My office broker was absolutely horrible. Her communication style was very selective. If I had a question no matter how many times I asked she would never reply, unless I called. It was so bad, I had to call on other broker/managers in other states to get answers to questions often times that would only take 1-2 minutes. At times it would take a week to get a signature even for my commission. It is the hardest thing to know in your heart you are being completely ignored.     I reached out to other broker/owners/and even VP to express my concerns which fell on deaf ears. Also, as I have seen from other agents if something were legally be an issue, the broker would readily ""send you down the river"" or not simply not answer to any requests unless it was from her hiring owner.     I feel so sorry for anyone who would come to this particular office in Carrington. Besides the direly low pay for REO assignments to have a office manager bankrupt in camaraderie can be devastating when faced with daily challenges of meeting sales and financial goals. Leaving was the best thing I ever did for my health and sanity. "
"Loan Officer, Centralized","Jeremy Drang is a racist and has created a hostile work environment for non white employees and women on the sales floor. I left to avoid being terminated due to unrealistic sales expectations. Having exhausted all possible remedies through HR and discussions with management, I felt forced to leave the company since none of my concerns were addressed. Not even racist remarks by Drang. My attorneys tell me this is constructive discharge. "
RE Sales Agent,Not agent friendly as compared to Realty  Direct Brokerage.  No one to address issues that greatly  Affected daily issues as well as appropriate  pay scheduling/timeliness etc.
"Specialist, Loan Servicing",Because of the new schedule swing shift
RE Sales Agent,Carrington does not understand the San Diego resale market.  Wendy Foresthy is a horrible leader.  She is all about herself.  Her own fame. There is no leadership or culture.  
RE Sales Agent,"When we joined the managing broker was Tammy Powell and all was good. She left shortly after we joined and once Deann Gladwell took over, things went down hill. Her communication was very poor, her understanding and explanation of procedures etc. was very poor. I'm not an agent that needs hand holding, I've been doing this for a long time.   I'd also suggest a clearer explanation of procedures for new agents, for dealing with Boomtown and how to obtain assets for clients.   Other than that, it's a great concept. "
"Loan Officer, Regional Sale Ctr, Outside","Management, Inexperienced Processors, Underwriting Dept.  Not enough space to elaborate the disappointing, unprofessional experience being employed at that branch and inconsistencies of UW reviews of files.  Carrington Realtor didn't want to use mortgage side due to bad experience prior to my file and he had to contact corporate numerous times for service & UW issues.  I gave my manager Letter of Resignation so hopefully HR received it and it will explain it more in detail."
"Coordinator, Vendor Relations",Was recruited by a friend and it paid more money
"Trainee, Loan Officer, I",I left Carrington Mortgage because I felt like I did not have the support from management that I needed to succeed. I also felt like I was discriminated against by the manager Jennifer Redman & I expressed this to upper level management during my resignation.     With that said I feel like had I been given a fair and equal chance to succeed as a loan officer I would have prospered at Carrington Mortgage. If given the chance again I would love to be part of the team and have Carrington prove that they give everyone a fair chance regardless to race. 
"Specialist, Loan Servicing",I left to start my own business and relocate to Florida. Also most of the managers are very unprofessional. 
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","Joe Rosario was my supervisor at the Westfield, IN location and Teresa was the manager over him, she never approved my request to transfer to another department in the company. Also she never gave me a reason why she declined my request. So I ended up leaving carrington mortgage. "
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","I have a passion for Customer Service and helping people in general.  I left Carrington because the bonuses that I had earned were taken away AFTER earning them fron a false accusation from a Supervisor - Joe who caught a rep trying to show me a pictire on her cell phone, the rep openly told the supervisor that I was completely unaware of her handing me her phone. I went to Teresa Reiger with my defense and referred her to the rep who willing admitted the mistake. No response from Customer Service Manager or HR on this issue. I waited for my next paycheck and saw the bonuses were not restored and resigned. I work to hard for my money for a mistake out of my control, not to collect my earnings.    Sincerely,  Kelly S. Wyckoff"
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",I was let go
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",I had been working as hard as I could to bonus for the month and two days before the bonus time frame ended I was written up for having my phone in my hand. I enjoyed the work I was doing and was looking to make a long term career at Carrington. At that point I  felt no other option but to resign from employment. 
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",I was promised full time got there got out of training and it was part time. Too far to drive for 4 or 5 hours. 
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","I was truly thankful for the opportunity of a position with Carrington.  The only reason that I left my position, after only 2 days of training, was that a company which I had applied to, called me.  I had applied to this company about the same time as I applied to Carrington.  I accepted their offer because it was 3 full days a week, instead of 5 part-time with Carrington.  It also was approximately 10 miles closer to my home.  Also, the rate of pay was more per hour than I was offered at Carrington.  I found Carrington to be a very nice place to work, with a very professional management staff.  The only thing I was disappointed with was my recruiter was very upset with me when I advised her of my decision.  I felt I did the right thing by driving into Carrington, returning all the new employee paperwork and small gifts I was given on my first day.  I understood the recruiter's position, but I also, tried to handle the situation in a professional manner.  I felt it would have been wrong to waste any more expense to Carrington by continuing the training.  I appreciated the opportunity to work for Carrington Mortgage."
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",I was in customer service and got calls from people asking questions that I had no idea how to answer.  Trying to find help wasn't easy.  When I went to a boss for help they were either on the phone or had a line already there asking questions.  They needed someone walking around to help the new people or a separate phone number we could call for help when trying to answer these questions.  It stressed me out so bad I decided to go back to my old job.
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","Honestly the stress of being on the phones constantly was a huge chunk of it. Dealing with angry customers not being able to assist them in a clear way, meaning that we had very little autonomy, very little we had control over. We couldn't make decisions on behalf of the customer that would benefit them. Our hands were virtually tied.  The job pays well for the responsibility so for that reason alone I would recommend it to someone else. It wasn't a good fit for me. Also the move from Fishers to Westfield was a little more daunting then I realized. It made the drive a little to far from me. Lastly there were a few business practices that I found unfair to the customer especially dealing with escrow and certain late fees. I did appreciate the fact that the job offered part time hours that was definitely helpful"
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","Mandatory overtime , managers did not like to teach new employees"
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS","I felt I was mislead and believed I would have full time hours & benefits, so finding out after training that I was gonna have to work my way to better hours, I was very disappointed. "
"Representative, Customer Service, CMS",Decided couldn't work the hours needed.
